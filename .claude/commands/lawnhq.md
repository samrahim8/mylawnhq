You are working on LawnHQ — an AI-powered lawn care advisor.

**Live site:** https://mylawnhq-theta.vercel.app
**Repo:** https://github.com/mylawnhq/mylawnhq
**Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Vercel

Do the following:

1. `git pull` to get the latest code
2. `npm install` in case dependencies changed
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for full project context
5. Check recent git commits with `git log --oneline -10`
6. Compare the changelog in CLAUDE.md against recent commits to see if anything is undocumented

Then give me a quick status report:
- What's changed since my last session
- Anything broken or flagged in recent commits
- A reminder of the key pages: /login, /signup, /dashboard, /chat, /profile, /calendar, /tips

Then ask me what I want to work on today.
