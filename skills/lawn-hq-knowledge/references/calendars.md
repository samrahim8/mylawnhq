# Lawn Care Seasonal Calendars

Use **temperature triggers** rather than fixed dates - adjust to your local climate.

## Lawn HQ Visual Calendar

For warm season grasses, refer to the **Lawn HQ Warm Season Calendar** at [assets/warm-season-calendar.pdf](../assets/warm-season-calendar.pdf)

This branded calendar shows all tasks at a glance with:
- **CRITICAL** tasks (grass icon) - Must do
- **RECOMMENDED** tasks (dark gray) - Should do
- **SAFE** periods (light gray) - Can do

**Key notes from the calendar:**
- Target mowing height: 1-1.5 inches
- Target watering: 1-1.5 inches per week
- Be patient the first growing year - let nature do its thing

## Adjustment by Region

### Deep South (GA, AL, FL, etc.)
- Earlier spring wake-up (Feb-Mar)
- Longer growing season
- Fall PE: Mid-November

### Transition Zone (TN, NC, OK, etc.)
- Later spring wake-up (Mar-Apr)
- Consider heat-tolerant grass varieties
- Can grow both warm and cool season

### Northern Zones
- Cool season grasses only
- Short growing season
- Focus on fall seeding
- Spring seeding challenging due to summer heat
