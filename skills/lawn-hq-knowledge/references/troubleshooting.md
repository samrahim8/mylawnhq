## Discoloration Issues

### Yellow Blades (Chlorosis)
**Appearance**: Grass blades turning yellow (not brown)

**Common Causes**:
1. Overwatering (constantly wet soil)
2. High phosphorus levels (locks up iron)
3. PH imbalance (high PH locks nutrients)
4. Nitrogen deficiency
5. Iron deficiency

**Quick Fix**:
- Spray with Super Juice + extra liquid iron

**Long-Term Fix**:
- Get soil test to identify root cause
- Adjust PH if needed
- Review watering schedule (should dry between waterings)
- Check if high-P fertilizer being used (like Milorganite)

---

### Red/Purple Tips
**Appearance**: Red or purple coloration on blade tips

**Common Causes**:
1. Cold stress (most common) - stray cold front in spring
2. Phosphorus deficiency (less common)

**Fix**:
- **Cold stress**: Goes away naturally in 2-3 weeks with warmer weather
- **P deficiency**: Apply light coat of 10-10-10

**Note**: Very common in spring, usually not cause for concern

---

### Brown Patches (Not Grub Damage)
**Appearance**: Irregular brown areas, grass still firmly rooted

**Common Causes**:
1. Fungus (see fungus section)
2. Drought stress/hot spots
3. Chemical burn
4. Dog urine
5. Scalping damage

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Tug on grass - comes up easily = grubs
2. Check irrigation coverage
3. Look for patterns (dog routes, mower path)
4. Examine for fungus signs

---

### Scalping/Brown Stripes
**Appearance**: Brown stripes or patches after mowing

**Cause**: Cutting into brown stalks below green blades

**Why It Happens**:
- Bermuda especially has 30% green on top, 70% brown stalk below
- Uneven ground causes mower to dip and cut too low
- Grass allowed to grow too tall before cutting

**Solutions**:
1. Keep grass short consistently (more frequent mowing)
2. Level lawn to reduce dips
3. Use wider mower (25" vs 20")
4. Add scalp wheels to rotary mower
5. Consider reel mower for cleaner cut

---

## Fungus and Disease

### Dollar Spot
**Appearance**: Small (silver dollar sized) tan/straw colored spots

**Conditions**: Humid weather, morning dew, nitrogen deficiency

**Treatment**:
1. Apply granular fungicide (DG type)
2. Follow label for repeat applications
3. After 3 apps, switch to different chemical class
4. Increase nitrogen slightly to help recovery

---

### Brown Patch
**Appearance**: Large irregular brown circles, often with darker border

**Conditions**: Hot humid weather, overwatering, excessive nitrogen

**Treatment**:
1. Apply granular fungicide
2. Reduce watering frequency
3. Avoid evening irrigation
4. Improve air circulation

---

### Fungus Prevention
- Apply granular fungicide when spring temps hit 80s
- Don't overwater
- Water in morning (not evening)
- Avoid excessive nitrogen in summer

---

## Pest Damage

### Grub Damage
**Appearance**: Brown patches that pull up like carpet (roots eaten)

**Other Signs**:
- Crows constantly feeding on lawn
- Armadillos or skunks digging
- Grubs visible 2-6" deep when sod folded back

**Treatment**:
1. Apply Duocide at HEAVY rate
2. Water in deeply (must reach grubs)
3. Apply PGF Complete after grubs killed
4. Recovery takes ~6 weeks

**Prevention**:
- Annual grub treatment recommended
- Spring AND late summer/early fall timing

---

### Armyworm Damage
**Appearance**: Thinned-out lawn, grass blades eaten (not roots)

**Other Signs**:
- Moth activity around lawn
- Worms visible in morning/evening (hide in thatch during day)
- Damage moves across lawn like an "army"

**Detection Test**:
- Mix dish soap with water
- Pour on suspected area
- Worms come to surface within minutes

**Treatment**:
1. Duocide at recommended rate
2. OR hose-end lawn pest spray
3. May need 2 treatments (egg hatch cycle)
4. Common timing: August-September in South

---

### Chinch Bugs (Especially St. Augustine)
**Appearance**: Irregular yellow-brown patches, especially near concrete/driveways (hot, dry areas)

**Why St. Augustine?**: Primary pest of St. Augustine lawns, less common in Bermuda/Zoysia

**Identification**: Small black bugs with white wings at edge of damaged areas

**Detection Test**:
- Part grass at edge of damage (where yellow meets green)
- Look for small bugs scurrying
- OR: Coffee can test - cut both ends off, push into soil, fill with water, bugs float up

**Treatment**:
1. Insecticide labeled for chinch bugs (bifenthrin, carbaryl)
2. Treat ENTIRE lawn, not just damaged spots
3. May need repeat application in 2 weeks
4. Water lawn before treatment (bugs closer to surface)

**Prevention**:
- Avoid drought stress
- Don't over-fertilize with nitrogen
- Maintain proper mowing height

## Weed Problems

### "My Lawn is All Weeds"
**Reality**: Can be restored - Bermuda especially is forgiving

**Aggressive Approach** ("Curtain of Death"):
1. Apply mix of all appropriate weed killers + pre-emergent
2. Do during warm/hot months
3. Bermuda will brown but not die
4. Fertilize and water heavily
5. Only Bermuda returns

**Gradual Approach**:
1. Start strict pre-emergent program
2. Spot treat existing weeds
3. Fertilize to encourage grass spread
4. Be patient - improvement over 1-2 seasons

---

### Weed Prevention (Best Strategy)
- Pre-emergent is CRITICAL
- Split application method:
  1. Granular 2 weeks before target
  2. Liquid with post-emergent after target
- Fall PE prevents winter weeds

**With good PE program**: Zero weed killer sprays needed

---

### Nutsedge
**Problem**: Pre-emergent does NOT control nutsedge

**Identification**: Triangular stem, grows faster than grass

**Treatment**: Specific nutsedge herbicide, spot treat

---

### Dallisgrass/Goosegrass
**Problem**: Very hard to kill selectively

**Treatment**:
- Spot treat with cloth + RoundUp (only on weed)
- Labor intensive
- Split PE application helps prevent

---

### Weeds After Scalping
**Problem**: Poa annua and other surface seeds germinate after scalping disturbs soil

**Solution**: Second PE application (liquid) after scalping

---

## Growth Issues

### Thin Lawn / Won't Thicken
**Possible Causes**:
1. Shade (especially Bermuda needs 8+ hrs sun)
2. Compacted soil (needs aeration)
3. Nutrient deficiency
4. Wrong grass type for conditions
5. Heavy thatch blocking water/nutrients

**Solutions**:
- Soil test first
- Lift tree canopy (trim up high)
- Core aeration
- Regular fertilizer program (PGF Complete)
- Address thatch with DirtBooster
- Consider if grass type matches your conditions

---

### Bare Spots Won't Fill
**For Spreading Grasses** (Bermuda, Zoysia, KBG):
- Should fill naturally if healthy
- Fertilize area specifically
- "Steal" runners from edges, plant in bare spots
- Ensure adequate water

**For Clump Grasses** (Fescue, Perennial Rye):
- Must overseed - these don't spread
- Best timing: Fall for cool season
- Keep seeded areas moist

---

### Shady Areas Poor Growth
**Reality**: Most lawn grasses need significant sun

**Solutions**:
1. Lift tree canopy (trim lower branches)
2. Raise mowing height in shade (+0.5"-1")
3. For cool season: Use fine fescue varieties
4. For warm season: Accept thinner growth or alternative groundcover
5. Ultimate solution: Remove shade source

---

## Environmental Damage

### Dog Urine Spots
**Cause**: High nitrogen in urine burns grass (NOT PH related)

**Solutions**:
1. Train dogs to use designated area
2. Flush area with water immediately after
3. Treat burned spots with Lawn Pee Spot cover-up
4. Bermuda/Zoysia will regrow into spots

---

### Drought Damage
**Appearance**: Brown, crispy grass, especially in "hot spots"

**Hot Spot Causes**:
- Tree roots competing for water
- Construction debris below surface
- Sandy soil pockets
- Septic drain areas

**Solutions**:
1. Short watering cycles during drought (6-9 min, 2x daily)
2. Hand water hot spots
3. Identify and map hot spots for future

**Recovery**: Warm season grasses recover well; cool season may need overseed

---

### Chemical Burn
**Appearance**: Brown patterns following application path

**Causes**:
1. Fertilizer applied to wet grass
2. Excessive application rate
3. Spills or overlap
4. Weed killer applied in heat

**Prevention**:
- Apply granular to dry grass, water in
- Follow label rates exactly
- Use appropriate spreader settings
- Avoid weed killer in high heat

**Recovery**: Water heavily, grass usually recovers

---

### Frost/Cold Damage
**Appearance**: Brown areas after unexpected cold snap

**For Warm Season**:
- Normal dormancy trigger
- Usually recovers in spring

**For Cool Season**:
- Purple/red tips common
- Recovers with warmer weather

---

## New Lawn Problems

### New Sod Not Establishing
**Common Issues**:
1. Drying out (not enough water)
2. Too wet (roots rotting)
3. Pre-emergent was applied (stops root growth)
4. Poor soil contact

**Solutions**:
1. Follow strict watering schedule: 3x daily week 1, 2x week 2, 1x week 3
2. Keep moist NOT saturated
3. No PE for 8-12 months on new sod
4. Roll lightly for soil contact

---

### New Seed Not Germinating
**Common Issues**:
1. Seed planted too deep (should be 1/8" - 1/2")
2. Not enough water (soil drying between waterings)
3. Bird/pest eating seed
4. Old/bad seed
5. Wrong season for grass type

**Solutions**:
1. Light, frequent watering (2-3x daily until germination)
2. Keep soil consistently moist
3. Use straw cover to protect and hold moisture
4. Verify seed freshness
5. Check temperature requirements for grass type

---

### Weeds in New Lawn
**Reality**: Some weeds expected first year

**Approach**:
1. Be gentle - no weed killer for first 2 months
2. Spot treat sparingly after 2 months
3. Full pre-emergent program starts SECOND year
4. Focus on grass health, not weed elimination

---

## Diagnostic Decision Tree

### Brown Patches Appearing

1. **Does grass pull up easily?**
   - YES → Grub damage (treat with Duocide)
   - NO → Continue to #2

2. **Is there a pattern?**
   - Circular/ring shaped → Fungus (treat with fungicide)
   - Following mower path → Scalping (adjust mowing)
   - Random spots → Continue to #3

3. **Check watering**
   - Always wet → Reduce watering, check for fungus
   - Dry/hot spots → Increase watering to those areas

4. **Recent applications?**
   - YES → Possible chemical burn (flush with water)
   - NO → Get soil test, check for pests
