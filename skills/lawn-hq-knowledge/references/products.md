## Soil Testing

### Why Test
- Know your PH level (target 6.0-6.5 for most grasses)
- Identify nutrient deficiencies/excesses
- Stop guessing, start knowing

### Recommended Testing
- Local extension office
- Clemson University testing service
- MySoil Test Kit (online option)

### Focus Areas
- PH level (most critical)
- Phosphorus level (affects what fertilizer to use)
- Look for wild spikes, don't over-read results

---

## Fertilizers

### Primary Fertilizer: PGF Complete 16-4-8
- **When**: Main growing season fertilizer (spring through early fall)
- **Why**: 4-1-2 ratio, 3 forms of nitrogen, 3% iron, micro nutrients, humic acid
- **Rate**: 0.58 lb N per 1000 sqft (mild enough to stack every 3-6 weeks)
- **Size**: Tiny professional-grade particles for even coverage
- **Use on**: ALL grass types (warm and cool season)

### Jump Start: PGF Balance 10-10-10
- **When**: Late winter (with pre-emergent), late fall (last treatment)
- **Why**: Balanced, fast-release, fills soil before grass wakes up
- **Rate**: 5 lbs per 1000 sqft

### Zero Phosphorus: PGF 16-0-8
- **When**: Soil test shows high phosphorus OR local regulations restrict P
- **Why**: Same benefits as Complete without adding more phosphorus

### Fast-Release Supplement: GreenShocker
- **When**: Anytime during growing season, especially summer
- **Why**: 100% fast release, results in 3 days, you control timing
- **Use**: Before rain/irrigation, fills gaps between slow-release apps

### Spray Supplement: Super Juice
- **When**: Every 2-3 weeks during growing season
- **Why**: Reaches every blade, contains iron for deep green, humic/fulvic acid
- **Use**: Mix dry powder with water, apply with hose-end sprayer
- **Note**: Very mild - won't push growth like granular

### Fast-Release: DGL (Dark Green Lawn) 25-0-0
- **What**: All fast-release nitrogen + 6% iron
- **When**: Need quick green-up
- **Coming**: Spring 2024

### Organic Option: INNOVA (Soy-Based)
- **When**: Summer on healthy lawns only
- **Why**: Can't burn, adds carbon and amino acids
- **Limitation**: Very mild, requires warm temps and microbes to work
- **NOT for**: Weak lawns, cool weather application

## Soil Amendments

### HUMICHAR (Biochar + Humic Acid Blend)
- **What**: 50/50 blend of biochar and humic acid in DG pellets
- **Why use**:
  - Adds carbon (lifeblood of soil)
  - Improves nutrient holding capacity (CEC)
  - Increases microbial activity
  - Eventually reduces fertilizer needs
- **When**: ANY time, with ANY product
- **Rate**: Cannot over-apply (no negative results from excess)
- **Key feature**: Ground extremely fine to reach root zone quickly (unlike other biochars that sit on surface)

### DirtBooster (Organic Matter + Microbe Booster)
- **What**: All-natural organic matter with included microbe/fungus spray
- **Why**: Feeds soil microbes and mycorrhizal fungi
- **When**: Temps above 80°F (microbes need warmth)
- **Frequency**: As often as you want
- **Benefit**: Helps break down thatch naturally

### Adjusting Soil PH

**Low PH (acidic) - Add Lime**:
- Pelletized lime: 50-100 lbs per 1000 sqft to raise 1 point
- Best time: During dormant season
- Retest in 3 months

**High PH (alkaline) - Add Sulfur**:
- Pelletized sulfur: 5 lbs per 1000 sqft
- Apply when air temps below 75°F
- May take years for large changes

---

## Pre-Emergents

### Granular Pre-Emergent (Primary)
- **When**: 2 weeks before target date (soil temp 51-53°F)
- **Duration**: 6-12 weeks protection
- **Apply**: While soil is dry, water in immediately
- **Note**: Do NOT apply to new sod (affects new root growth)

### Liquid Pre-Emergent Concentrate
- **When**: Just after target date (second application)
- **Why**: Also has post-emergent properties for escaped crabgrass
- **Application**: Mix and spray

### Fall Pre-Emergent
- Apply when first cold weather hits
- Prevents winter weeds (poa annua)
- Use granular product

---

## Weed Killers

### Categories of Weeds
1. **Broadleaf weeds** - Easy kill with standard herbicides
2. **Grassy weeds** - Easy kill
3. **Crabgrass** - Medium difficulty (PE is key)
4. **Nutsedge** - Medium difficulty (PE doesn't control)
5. **Dallisgrass/Goosegrass** - Very hard kill

### Application Guidelines
- **Winter**: Wait for warm spell (weed killers don't work in freezing temps)
- **Summer**: Use caution, read labels (may yellow/brown grass temporarily)
- Read labels for surface vs. systemic action

### For Bermuda/Zoysia Safe
- Use products specifically labeled for warm season turf
- NEVER use RoundUp/total kill during dormancy (grass is never 100% dormant)

### Dallisgrass/Goosegrass Treatment
- Spot treat with RoundUp on tiny cloth, apply ONLY to weed
- Labor intensive but saves surrounding grass

### "Curtain of Death" (Extreme Weed Infestation)
For lawns 70%+ weeds:
1. Apply mix of all weed killers + pre-emergent during warm/hot months
2. This browns Bermuda too but doesn't kill it
3. Fertilize and water heavily
4. Only Bermuda comes back

## Pest Control

### Grubs and Armyworms: Duocide
- **For**: White grubs (root eaters) and armyworms (blade eaters)
- **When**:
  - Grubs: Spring and late summer/early fall
  - Armyworms: Late summer (Aug-Sept in South)
- **Application**: Heavy rate, water in deeply (must reach grubs 2-6" down)
- **Important**: Do NOT substitute other products (even if bag claims grub control)

### Signs of Grubs
- Brown dying patches that pull up easily
- Crows constantly on lawn
- Armadillos/skunks digging

### Signs of Armyworms
- Thinned-out lawn appearance
- Moth activity
- Visible worms in thatch (morning/evening)

### Backup Armyworm Treatment
- Hose-end lawn pest spray (Bayer or similar)
- May need 2 treatments due to egg hatch cycle

---

## Fungicides

### Granular Fungicide (DG)
- **When**: Preventative - apply when temps hit 80s in spring
- **Why**: DG particles give excellent coverage
- **Duration**: Longer lasting than sprays
- **Treatment**: Follow label rate, up to 3 applications

### After 3 Applications
- Must switch to different chemical (fungus develops resistance)
- Use Bio-Advanced spray product

### Common Fungus Types
- **Dollar Spot**: Small tan circles
- **Brown Patch**: Larger irregular brown patches
- Both treatable with same fungicides

---

## Equipment

### Spreaders
- Pro-grade spreader recommended for even distribution
- Essential for granular products

### Hose-End Spray Bottles
- Use 20:1 ratio bottles ONLY
- Price check: Should be ~$19 for 2 bottles max
- Don't overpay when out of stock

### Reel Mowers
- **McLane 25"** (recommended): Front roller, lighter weight, less maintenance
- **Tru-Cut**: Well-made but heavier

### Rotary Mowers
- Need scalp wheels and know how to adjust
- More scalp wheels = better
- Must cut down to 0.75" for scalping

### Dethatchers
- BLADED dethatchers only for spreading grasses
- NOT prong-type (pulls up runners)
- Sun Joe AJ801E is good option

### Core Aerators
- Rent CORE-pulling type (not spike)
- Pick up cores rather than leaving
