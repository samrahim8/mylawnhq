## Profile Fields and How to Use Them

### Zip Code (Required)
**What it tells you**: Geographic location for climate/weather context

**How to use it**:
- Determine USDA hardiness zone and climate type
- Adjust seasonal timing recommendations (Southern states start earlier)
- Reference local weather conditions when relevant
- Estimate typical first/last frost dates
- Suggest appropriate grass varieties for the region

**Example adjustments**:
| Region | Spring Wake-up | Fall Dormancy | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Deep South (FL, South GA, South TX) | Feb-Mar | Dec | Longer growing season |
| Mid-South (GA, AL, SC, NC) | Mar-Apr | Nov | Typical warm season zone |
| Transition Zone (TN, OK, North TX, VA) | Apr | Oct-Nov | Can grow warm or cool season |

---

### Grass Type (Required)
**Options**: Bermuda, Zoysia, Fescue/KBG, St. Augustine

**How to use it**:

| Grass Type | Season | Sun Needs | Cut Height | Key Traits |
|------------|--------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Bermuda** | Warm | 8+ hrs (full sun only) | 0.75"-1.5" | Most aggressive spreader, very drought-tolerant, hates shade, goes dormant in winter |
| **Zoysia** | Warm | 6-8 hrs | 0.5"-2" | Dense growth, slower spreading, less scalping, more shade-tolerant than Bermuda |
| **Fescue/KBG** | Cool | 4-6+ hrs (some shade OK) | 2.5"-4" | Fescue is clump-forming, KBG spreads via rhizomes, struggles in summer heat |
| **St. Augustine** | Warm | 4-6+ hrs (most shade-tolerant warm grass) | 2.5"-4" | Spreads via stolons, popular in FL/Gulf Coast, doesn't tolerate heavy traffic |

**Seasonal differences**:

| Grass Type | Peak Growth | Dormancy | Fertilize When |
|------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Bermuda** | Summer (80-95°F) | Winter (brown) | Spring through early fall |
| **Zoysia** | Summer (80-95°F) | Winter (brown) | Spring through early fall |
| **Fescue/KBG** | Spring & Fall (60-75°F) | Summer stress (may brown) | Fall primary, early spring secondary |
| **St. Augustine** | Summer (80-90°F) | Winter (brown, less dormant in FL) | Spring through fall |

**Key care differences**:

**Bermuda**:
- Needs FULL sun - will fail in shade
- Cut SHORT (0.75-1.5") for best results
- Spring scalping is critical
- Most aggressive recovery from damage
- Pre-emergent program essential
- Reference: [warm-season.md](warm-season.md)

**Zoysia**:
- Tolerates slightly less sun than Bermuda
- Can cut short (0.5-2") depending on variety
- Spring scalping recommended
- Slower to spread/recover than Bermuda
- Pre-emergent program essential
- Reference: [warm-season.md](warm-season.md)

**Fescue/KBG (Cool Season)**:
- Tolerates partial shade
- Keep TALL (2.5-4") especially in summer
- NO scalping - never cut more than 1/3 of blade
- Fertilize primarily in FALL (opposite of warm season)
- May go dormant or struggle in summer heat
- Overseed in fall to thicken (Fescue doesn't spread)
- Reference: [cool-season.md](cool-season.md)

**St. Augustine**:
- Best warm-season grass for shade (4-6 hrs OK)
- Keep TALL (2.5-4") - never scalp
- Spreads via stolons (above ground runners)
- Very popular in Florida, Texas, Gulf Coast
- Sensitive to some herbicides (check labels!)
- Doesn't handle heavy foot traffic well
- Chinch bugs are common pest
- Reference: [warm-season.md](warm-season.md) (with St. Augustine notes)

### Lawn Size
**Options**: Small (<2,500 sq ft), Medium (2,500-10,000 sq ft), Large (>10,000 sq ft)

**How to use it**:

**Product Calculations** (use midpoint if exact sq ft unknown):
| Size | Assumed Sq Ft | PGF Complete (18lb bag covers 5,000 sq ft) |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Small | ~1,500 sq ft | ~1/3 bag per application |
| Medium | ~6,000 sq ft | ~1.2 bags per application |
| Large | ~15,000 sq ft | ~3 bags per application |

**Equipment recommendations**:
| Size | Mower Suggestion | Spreader Suggestion |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Small | Push reel or small rotary | Handheld broadcast |
| Medium | 20-25" reel or quality rotary | Walk-behind broadcast |
| Large | 25"+ reel or riding mower | Large walk-behind or tow-behind |

**Time/effort context**:
- Small: Weekend warrior friendly, manual tasks feasible
- Medium: Plan for 2-3 hours per major task
- Large: Consider efficiency tools, may want to hire for scalping

**If exact sq ft is provided** (from Google Maps tracing):
- Calculate precise product quantities
- Provide specific bag counts: "You'll need exactly 2.4 bags"
- Round up for purchasing: "Buy 3 bags to be safe"

---

### Sun Exposure (Required)
**Options**: Full Sun (6+ hrs), Partial (3-6 hrs), Shade (<3 hrs)

**How to use it**:

| Exposure | Bermuda Viability | Zoysia Viability | Recommendations |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Full Sun** | Excellent ✓ | Excellent ✓ | Standard care program |
| **Partial** | Marginal ⚠️ | Acceptable | Raise mow height, expect thinner growth, manage expectations |
| **Shade** | Poor ✗ | Marginal ⚠️ | Warn about limitations, suggest alternatives, lift tree canopy |

**Key advice by exposure**:

**Full Sun**:
- Standard recommendations apply
- Watch for drought stress in summer
- Prime conditions for golf-course quality lawn

**Partial Sun**:
- Raise cutting height 0.5" above normal
- Grass will be thinner - this is normal
- More susceptible to fungus (less air circulation)
- Consider removing shade sources if possible
- "Your lawn can be healthy but won't be as dense as full-sun areas"

**Shade**:
- Set realistic expectations immediately
- Bermuda will struggle significantly
- Zoysia may survive but won't thrive
- Strongly recommend: Lift tree canopy, remove lower branches
- Consider alternative groundcovers for deep shade
- "Warm season grasses really need more sun - let's discuss options"

### Soil Type (Optional)
**Options**: Clay, Sandy, Loam, Unknown

**How to use it**:

| Soil Type | Characteristics | Adjustments |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Clay** | Holds water, compacts easily, slow drainage | More aeration needed, watch for overwatering, drainage issues |
| **Sandy** | Drains fast, doesn't hold nutrients | More frequent watering, nutrients leach quickly, add organic matter |
| **Loam** | Ideal balance, good drainage + retention | Standard recommendations, lucky you! |
| **Unknown** | User hasn't tested | Encourage soil test, use general recommendations |

**Product adjustments**:
- **Clay**: Emphasize aeration, gypsum can help, careful not to overwater
- **Sandy**: More frequent lighter fertilizer apps, HUMICHAR especially beneficial, water more often
- **Loam**: Standard program works well

**If Unknown**: 
- Recommend soil test
- Suggest observing: "Does water pool after rain? (clay) Does it dry out in a day? (sandy)"

---

### Spreader Type (Optional)
**Options**: Broadcast (rotary), Drop, Handheld, None/Unknown

**How to use it**:
Provide specific spreader settings for products when known.

**Common Spreader Settings for PGF Complete**:

|----------------|---------|
| Scotts Elite | 3.5 |
| Scotts Deluxe | 5 |
| Scotts Standard | 5.5 |
| Earthway 2150 | 18 |
| Lesco | 18 |
| Spyker | 4.25 |
| Chapin | 12 |

**If None/Unknown**:
- Recommend getting a broadcast spreader for medium+ lawns
- Handheld is fine for small lawns and spot treatments
- "A good spreader makes a huge difference in even coverage"

## Personalization Examples

### Example 1: Basic Profile
**Profile**: Zip 30301 (Atlanta), Bermuda, Medium lawn, Full Sun

**Personalized response to "When should I fertilize?"**:
> "In Atlanta, your Bermuda should be waking up in late March when daily highs hit the 70s. Start with PGF Complete once you see a full green haze across the lawn - usually early to mid-April. For your medium-sized lawn (around 5,000-6,000 sq ft), you'll need about 1 bag of PGF Complete per application. Apply every 4-6 weeks through the growing season."

### Example 2: Detailed Profile
**Profile**: Zip 32832 (Orlando), Bermuda, 4,200 sq ft (exact), Full Sun, Sandy soil, Scotts Elite spreader, In-ground irrigation

**Personalized response to "When should I fertilize?"**:
> "In Orlando, your Bermuda has a longer growing season - you can start fertilizing as early as mid-March when you see green-up. For your 4,200 sq ft lawn, you'll need just under 1 bag of PGF Complete per application. Set your Scotts Elite spreader to 3.5 and make two perpendicular passes for even coverage.
>
> Since you have sandy soil, nutrients will leach faster than clay - consider applying every 3-4 weeks rather than 6 weeks, or supplement with Super Juice spray between granular apps. Your irrigation system makes this easy to water in right after application."

### Example 3: Challenging Conditions
**Profile**: Zip 37211 (Nashville), Zoysia, Large lawn, Partial shade, Clay soil

**Personalized response to "How do I get my lawn thicker?"**:
> "A few factors are working against you here, but we can definitely improve things:
>
> 1. **Partial shade** is limiting your Zoysia's density - it really wants 6+ hours of sun. If possible, trim up any trees to lift the canopy and let more light in.
>
> 2. **Clay soil** may be compacted, limiting root growth. I'd recommend core aeration this spring (April-May in Nashville) to help.
>
> 3. **Raise your mow height** to 2" in the shadier areas - this helps the grass capture more sunlight.
>
> 4. **Fertilize consistently** with PGF Complete every 4-6 weeks once temps hit the 70s (typically mid-April for you). For your large lawn, plan on 3 bags per application.
>
> With patience and these adjustments, you should see improvement over the season. Just know that partial shade areas will never be as thick as full-sun areas - that's normal."

## When Profile Data is Missing

If key fields are empty, ask before giving advice:

**Missing grass type**:
> "I'd love to help! First, what type of grass do you have? Bermuda, Zoysia, or a mix?"

**Missing location**:
> "To give you the right timing, what's your zip code? Lawn care schedules vary quite a bit by climate."

**Missing size for product questions**:
> "How big is your lawn? Even a rough estimate helps me tell you how much product you'll need."

Don't ask for optional fields unless directly relevant to the question.
