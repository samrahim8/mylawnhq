## Grass Characteristics

### Bermuda Grass
- **Sun requirement**: 8+ hours full sun daily (does NOT tolerate shade)
- **Ideal height**: 0.75" - 1.5"
- **Growth**: Most aggressive spreading grass via rhizomes (underground) and stolons (above ground)
- **Dormancy**: Goes brown when frost hits, wakes with consistent 70°F+ temps
- **Recovery**: Extremely forgiving - even 70%+ weed lawns can be restored

### Zoysia Grass
- **Sun requirement**: 6-8+ hours (slightly more shade tolerant than Bermuda)
- **Ideal height**: 0.5" - 2" (finer blade = lower cut)
- **Growth**: Slower spreading than Bermuda via rhizomes and stolons
- **Dormancy**: Similar to Bermuda
- **Characteristics**: Less "stalky" than Bermuda - fewer brown scalp marks

### St. Augustine Grass
- **Sun requirement**: 4-6+ hours (MOST shade-tolerant warm season grass)
- **Ideal height**: 2.5" - 4" (keep it TALL - never scalp)
- **Growth**: Spreads via stolons only (above ground runners), no rhizomes
- **Dormancy**: Goes brown in winter, less dormant in South Florida
- **Characteristics**: Wide, coarse blade; poor traffic tolerance; very popular in FL, TX, Gulf Coast
- **Common varieties**: Floratam (most common), Palmetto, Seville, CitraBlue

### Hybrid vs Common Bermuda
- **Hybrid**: Lab-developed, no viable seed, sold as sod/plugs, fine blade, dense growth
- **Common**: Available as cheap seed, thick coarse blade, different texture/color
- **Warning**: Never overseed hybrid sod with common seed - creates texture/color mismatch

## Seasonal Stages

| Season | Grass Status | Key Actions |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Winter** | Dormant (brown but alive) | PH adjustments, add HUMICHAR, NO RoundUp |
| **Early Spring** | Waking up (green haze) | Pre-emergent, Jump Start program, kill existing weeds |
| **Late Spring** | Accelerating growth (80s temps) | Scalp, fertilize, runners spreading |
| **Early Summer** | Surge growth (90s temps) | Regular mowing, watch for bugs/fungus |
| **Mid Summer** | Peak growth | Water management, light feeding only |
| **Fall** | Slowing growth | Grub treatment, pre-emergent before frost |

## Mowing

### Cutting Height
- **Bermuda**: 0.75" - 1.5" ideal
- **Zoysia**: 0.5" - 2" (depends on variety)
- **St. Augustine**: 2.5" - 4" (keep it TALL - never go below 2.5")
- **Problem with tall grass (Bermuda/Zoysia)**: 30% green on top, 70% brown stalk below = ugly scalp marks
- **St. Augustine note**: Taller height is REQUIRED - cutting too short damages the grass

### Frequency
- During peak growth: Every 2-3 days for short lawns
- Never remove more than 1/3 of blade height
- Golf courses cut fairways every 1-2 days

### Best Mowers
- **Reel mowers**: Best for short cuts (McLane 25" recommended)
- **Rotary mowers**: OK but more scalping issues - need scalp wheels
- Keep blades SHARP - dull blades rip/tear vs clean cut

### Clippings
- Return clippings if cutting frequently
- Bag only if: excessive growth, wet grass, piles forming
- Thatch layer up to 0.5" is healthy - holds moisture

### Dethatching
- Do NOT use prong dethatchers on spreading grasses - pulls up runners
- Use BLADED dethatcher if needed (after scalping)
- Better: Apply DirtBooster to break down thatch naturally

---

## Fertilizing

### Recommended NPK Ratio
Without soil test: Use **4-1-2 ratio** (e.g., 16-4-8)
- This is universally recommended by extension offices
- PGF Complete 16-4-8 is the primary recommendation

### Application Schedule
- **Jump Start** (late winter): PGF Balance 10-10-10
- **Growing Season**: PGF Complete every 3-6 weeks
- **Summer**: Light supplements only (GreenShocker, Super Juice)
- **Fall**: Taper off granular, use fast-release supplements until frost

### Key Fertilizer Principles
1. Feed the SOIL, not the plant
2. Excess nutrients do NOT produce better results
3. Avoid "weed and feed" combo products
4. Tiny particle size = better coverage (professional grade)

### Supplements
- **GreenShocker**: 100% fast-release, results in 3 days, safe for summer
- **Super Juice**: Spray supplement with iron, humic/fulvic acid - every 2-3 weeks
- Purpose: Fill gaps between granular applications, summer feeding

### Organic Fertilizers
- **Pros**: Add carbon, amino acids, can't burn lawn
- **Cons**: Very mild, require microbes to digest (need warm temps), won't push weak lawns
- **Best use**: Healthy lawns in summer
- **Weak lawns**: Use chemical fertilizer like PGF Complete instead

---

## Watering

### General Rule
- 1 inch per week total
- Deep and infrequent is better than shallow and frequent

### Drought Conditions
- Switch to short cycles: 6-9 minutes per zone, morning AND late afternoon
- Identify and hand-water "hot spots" (tree roots, construction debris areas)

### New Sod
- Week 1: 3x daily
- Week 2: 2x daily
- Week 3: 1x daily
- Keep moist but NOT wet

---

## Pre-Emergent Program

**"Pre-Emergent is God's gift to lawn owners."**

### How Pre-Emergents Work
- Stop new cell growth on contact
- Since they're in soil, they contact newly sprouted weed seeds and roots
- Stop root growth = seedling dies

### Split Application Method
1. **First app**: Granular PE 2 weeks BEFORE target date (soil temp ~51-53°F)
2. **Second app**: Liquid PE with post-emergent properties just AFTER target date

### Target Dates
- Check local soil temps: 51-53°F constant is when crabgrass germinates
- Use greencastonline.com/tools/soil-temperature for your area

### Fall Pre-Emergent
- Apply when first cold weather hits (Nov 15 typical)
- Prevents winter weeds like poa annua
- Does NOT prevent spring weeds

### Important
- Do NOT apply PE to new sod for 8-12 months (affects new root growth)
- Aeration does NOT ruin PE effectiveness

---

## Spring Scalping

### Why Scalp?
- Dead brown grass from winter is 2-3" tall
- Want green lawn at 1-1.5" but no one will see it under brown
- Must remove dead material for sun to reach new growth

### How to Scalp
- Cut to 50% of desired growing season height
- Example: Want 1.5" lawn → scalp to 0.75"
- Bag and remove ALL dead clippings

### When to Scalp
- When you see total "green haze" across lawn
- Daily temps consistently reaching 70s
- Georgia: Late March - Early April typical

### Tips
- Scalp gradually over 4-6 weeks if overwhelmed
- Hard on equipment - be prepared
- Watch for poa annua regrowth after disturbing surface seeds

## Jump Start Program

### Concept
Wake your lawn into a healthy environment - don't play catch-up.

### Step 1: Soil Test (Winter)
- Know your deficiencies and PH
- Skip if unwilling - move to Step 2

### Step 2: Early Treatment (Soil temps ~50°F)
Apply together:
1. Granular pre-emergent
2. HUMICHAR (soil health, carbon, CEC improvement)
3. PGF Balance 10-10-10 (mild nutrient boost - NOT nitrogen push)

### Step 3: Kill Existing Weeds
- NOW is the time - grass still dormant
- Use Bermuda/Zoysia safe weed killer
- Do NOT use RoundUp/total kill - grass is never 100% dormant
- Wait for rain/irrigation before mowing

---

## Seeding and Sod

### Best Time to Seed
- Daytime temps in 80s (late spring/early summer)
- DO NOT seed in early spring or fall

### Seed Prep
1. Kill weeds 2-3 weeks before (NO pre-emergent for 3+ months prior)
2. Rain must wash away weed killers
3. Scarify/rake soil
4. Seed wants to be 1/8" - 1/4" deep

### Seed Watering
- 2-3x daily (light) until germination
- 1x daily for next 2 weeks
- Keep soil moist, not saturated

### New Lawn Care
- Be GENTLE first year
- No weed killers for 2 months, sparingly after
- No pre-emergent for 8-12 months
- Full program starts SECOND year

### High-Quality Bermuda Seed
- Avoid big box store "common" bermuda
- Quality seed costs $7-35 per POUND
- Replicates hybrid sod appearance

---

## Leveling

### Leveling Mix
- Ideal: 70% sand + 30% organic matter
- Pure sand OK but gets hot and plants don't thrive

### Process
1. Scalp lawn to ground (leveling GROUND, not grass)
2. Apply leveling mix (typically 1/4" - 1/2" at a time)
3. Work into low spots with drag mat or back of rake
4. Water in

### Timing
- ONLY during growing season
- Work gets washed away during dormancy
- May take multiple applications for truly level lawn

### Alternative for Large Ruts
- Rolling in OFF season (when soil is moist, not wet)
- Reel mower helps hide imperfections with clean cut

---

## Aeration

### Best Time
- Late spring during ACTIVE growth
- Allows lawn to recover and fill in

### Method
- Use CORE PULLING aerator (not spike)
- Pick up and remove cores (they cause mess, cover grass from sun)

### After Aeration
- Great time to apply HUMICHAR
- Use blower to force particles into holes
- Pre-emergent effectiveness is NOT affected

## St. Augustine Specific Care

St. Augustine differs from Bermuda/Zoysia in several important ways. This section covers what's different.

### Key Differences from Bermuda/Zoysia

| Factor | Bermuda/Zoysia | St. Augustine |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Mowing height** | Short (0.5-1.5") | TALL (2.5-4") |
| **Spring scalping** | Yes, critical | NO - never scalp |
| **Shade tolerance** | Poor to moderate | Best warm-season for shade |
| **Traffic tolerance** | Excellent | Poor |
| **Spreading** | Rhizomes + stolons | Stolons only |
| **Recovery speed** | Fast | Slower |
| **Herbicide sensitivity** | Most are safe | CHECK LABELS - sensitive to many |

### St. Augustine Mowing Rules
1. **Never cut below 2.5"** - exposes stolons to sun damage
2. **Ideal height: 3-3.5"** in most conditions
3. **Raise to 4"** in summer heat or shady areas
4. **Never remove more than 1/3** of blade height
5. **NO spring scalping** - this damages St. Augustine severely

### St. Augustine Fertilizing
- Same NPK ratios apply (4-1-2 without soil test)
- PGF Complete works well
- **Iron is important** - St. Augustine is prone to chlorosis (yellowing)
- Fertilize spring through fall (same as Bermuda/Zoysia)
- **Avoid excessive nitrogen** in summer - increases disease susceptibility

### St. Augustine Watering
- Needs MORE water than Bermuda
- **Signs of drought stress**: Folded leaf blades, blue-gray color, footprints remain visible
- Deep, infrequent watering preferred
- 1-1.5" per week during growing season

### St. Augustine Common Problems

**Chinch Bugs** (Most common St. Augustine pest):
- Signs: Irregular yellow/brown patches, often starting near concrete/pavement (hot areas)
- Damage spreads outward
- Test: Part grass at edge of damaged area, look for small black bugs with white wings
- Treatment: Insecticide labeled for chinch bugs, treat entire lawn

**Gray Leaf Spot** (Common fungus):
- Signs: Gray/brown spots on blades with dark borders
- Worse in humid conditions, over-fertilized lawns
- Treatment: Reduce nitrogen, apply fungicide, improve air circulation

**Take-All Root Rot**:
- Signs: Yellow patches, roots are brown/rotted
- Worse in stressed lawns, high pH soils
- Treatment: Lower pH if high, apply fungicide, reduce stress

**Brown Patch**:
- Same as Bermuda/Zoysia - see fungus section above

### St. Augustine Herbicide Warnings

⚠️ **St. Augustine is sensitive to many herbicides - ALWAYS check labels**

**AVOID on St. Augustine**:
- 2,4-D at high rates (low rates may be OK - check label)
- MSMA / DSMA (arsenicals)
- Atrazine during hot weather (>85°F)
- Many "weed and feed" products

**Generally SAFE for St. Augustine**:
- Atrazine (when temps below 85°F) - great for broadleaf weeds
- Celsius (for grassy weeds)
- Sedgehammer (for nutsedge)
- Manor/Blade (for broadleaf)

**Always**: Read the label, follow rates exactly, don't apply when stressed

### St. Augustine Pre-Emergent
- Same timing as Bermuda/Zoysia (soil temps 51-53°F)
- Most pre-emergents are safe for St. Augustine
- Prodiamine, Dithiopyr, Pendimethalin all OK

### St. Augustine and Shade
St. Augustine is the best choice for warm-season lawns with shade:
- Tolerates 4-6 hours of sun (filtered light OK)
- **Palmetto** and **Seville** varieties are most shade-tolerant
- **Floratam** needs more sun (6+ hours)
- In shade: Raise mowing height to 4", reduce nitrogen, expect thinner growth

### When to Choose St. Augustine vs Bermuda/Zoysia

**Choose St. Augustine if**:
- You have significant shade (4-6 hours sun)
- You're in Florida, Gulf Coast, or South Texas
- You don't have heavy foot traffic
- You want a coarser, more tropical look
- You're OK with taller mowing heights

**Choose Bermuda if**:
- You have full sun (8+ hours)
- You want a short, golf-course look
- You have heavy traffic areas
- You want aggressive spreading/recovery
- You're OK with winter dormancy (brown)

**Choose Zoysia if**:
- You have moderate sun (6-8 hours)
- You want dense, carpet-like turf
- You want less maintenance than Bermuda
- You want something between Bermuda and St. Augustine
