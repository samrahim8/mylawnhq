## Grass Types and Characteristics

### Tall Fescue
- **Growth**: Clump-forming via tillers (does NOT spread via runners)
- **Cutting height**: 2.5" - 4"
- **Pros**: Drought tolerant, traffic tolerant, easy care
- **Cons**: Must overseed thin areas
- **Blade**: Flat, slightly wider
- **Sun**: Full sun preferred, some shade-tolerant varieties
- **Note**: Avoid K-31 pasture fescue (coarse blade, pale color)

### Fine Fescue
- **Blade**: Very fine, soft appearance
- **Best use**: Shade areas only
- **Cons**: Less drought/wear tolerant, NOT for hot sunny areas
- **Types**: Chewings fescue, creeping red fescue

### Perennial Ryegrass
- **Growth**: Clump-forming via tillers
- **Cutting height**: 1.5" - 2.5" (sod grade: down to 0.5" with reel mower)
- **Germination**: Rapid - good for overseeding
- **Pros**: Fine to medium texture, dark green, wear tolerant
- **Cons**: Poor shade and drought tolerance
- **Mixing**: Often 20% in KBG or fescue blends

### Kentucky Bluegrass (KBG)
- **Growth**: Spreads via tillers AND rhizomes (self-repairs)
- **Cutting height**: 2" - 3" standard; sod grade varieties: down to 0.25" with reel
- **Pros**: Cold tolerant, wear tolerant, beautiful appearance
- **Cons**: Higher nitrogen needs (2-4 lb N/1000 sqft/season), thatch producer
- **Best conditions**: Well-drained, sunny areas
- **Recovery**: Goes semi-dormant in drought, recovers with cooler temps/moisture

## Growing Zones

Cool season grasses thrive in northern climates and "transition zones."

### Key Considerations
- Research specific variety tolerance for your temperatures
- Transition zone: Consider heat-tolerant tall fescue or KBG varieties
- Deep cold winters: Ensure variety matches hardiness
- Fine fescues: Best for shade, NOT hot sunny areas

---

## Mowing

### Cutting Heights
| Grass Type | Standard Height | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Tall Fescue | 2.5" - 4" | Higher in shade |
| Fine Fescue | 2.5" - 3.5" | Shade areas |
| Perennial Rye | 1.5" - 2.5" | Sod grade: 0.5"+ |
| Kentucky Bluegrass | 2" - 3" | Sod grade: 0.25"+ |

### Mower Type
- **Rotary mowers**: Standard for most cool season lawns (longer grass)
- **Reel mowers**: Only for premium short-cut lawns (<1")
- Keep blades SHARP - dull blades cause ripping

### Frequency
- Cut weekly during growing season
- Peak growth may require more frequent cutting
- Never remove more than 1/3 of blade height

### Shade Areas
- Raise cutting height 0.5" - 1" taller
- "Raising antenna for better signal" - more blade = more sunlight capture

## Fertilizing

### Why NOT Organic for Cool Season
- Organics require microbe digestion to release nutrients
- Microbes need warm temps (65°F+ soil)
- Cool season fertilizing happens in COOLER weather
- Therefore: Standard chemical fertilizers preferred (work regardless of temp)

### Recommended NPK Ratio
Without soil test: **4-1-2 ratio** (e.g., 16-4-8, 32-8-16)

### Fertilizer Schedule by Season

| Season | Product | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Late Winter/Early Spring | PGF Balance 10-10-10 | Jump start - mild, fast release |
| Early Spring (green up) | PGF Complete 16-4-8 | When grass actively growing |
| Late Spring | PGF Complete or Super Juice | Depending on growth |
| Summer | Light supplements ONLY | Green Shocker, Super Juice before rain |
| Early Fall | PGF Complete 16-4-8 | Resume slow release |
| Late Fall | PGF Balance 10-10-10 | Last treatment of season |

### Key Principles
1. Feed the SOIL, not the plant
2. Excess nutrients do NOT improve results
3. Without soil test, use balanced 4-1-2 ratio
4. Avoid "weed and feed" combo products

### When to Vary Numbers
1. Soil test shows excess/deficiency
2. Green-up period (higher nitrogen)
3. Slow growth period (lower nitrogen)

### Supplements
- **Super Juice**: Spray every 2-3 weeks, contains iron for deep green
- **Green Shocker**: Fast-release granular, results in 3 days, summer-safe
- Use supplements to "spoon feed" during summer stress

---

## Watering

### Established Lawns
- 1" of water per week total
- Deep and infrequent (NOT constantly wet)
- Wet soil = fungus and chlorosis

### New Seed/Sod
- Weeks 1-2: 2-3x daily, short waterings
- Weeks 3-4: Every other day
- Then: 3-4x weekly during heat

### Hot Spots
- Areas with tree roots, construction debris dry faster
- May need hand watering during hot weather

---

## Pre-Emergent Program

### Timing
- Apply when soil temps reach 51-53°F
- Check: greencastonline.com/tools/soil-temperature

### Split Application
1. Granular PE 2 weeks before target date
2. Liquid PE with post-emergent just after target date

### Fall Pre-Emergent
- Apply as cold weather approaches (Nov typical)
- Prevents winter weeds (poa annua)

### Important Notes
- Do NOT apply PE if planning to seed within 3+ months
- New sod: No PE for 8-12 months

---

## Seeding

### Best Time
- **FALL is primary season** - roots develop before summer heat
- Spring overseeding possible with irrigation

### Seed Depth
- 1/8" - 1/2" deep
- Scarify lawn after spreading (loosens soil contact)

### Germination
- Cool season seeds germinate quickly
- Fescue: 7-14 days
- Perennial Rye: 5-10 days
- KBG: 14-30 days

### Seeding Rates
- Vary by variety and new lawn vs overseed
- Follow bag label for variety-specific rates
- KBG has smaller seeds = more seed per pound

### Mixing Grasses
- Common: KBG + Perennial Rye for drought/disease benefits
- For strength: One grass type, 3 varieties recommended
- Address specific problems with specific varieties (shade areas = fine fescue)

---

## Aeration and Dethatching

### Aeration
- Best time: During strong GROWING period
- Use CORE pulling aerator (not spike)
- Great time to apply HUMICHAR into holes

### Dethatching
- Short lawns (0.25" - 1") rarely need dethatching
- Thatch up to 0.5" is healthy
- Use SPRING TINE dethatcher to pull dead grass
- Can be part of late winter/early spring cleanup
- Rake up and remove debris

### Rolling
- Consumer rollers (water/sand filled) have little impact
- Not worth the effort/sore body
- Commercial pavement rollers work for frost heave damage

---

## Season by Season Care

### Winter (Dormant)
- Nothing to do
- BEST time for PH adjustments (lime if low)
- Apply HUMICHAR (carbon takes time to work down)

### Late Winter/Early Spring
- Apply pre-emergent (2 weeks before target)
- Jump Start Program: PE + HUMICHAR + PGF Balance 10-10-10
- Clean up dead leaves/debris

### Early Spring
- Cut dead grass short, bag and remove
- Light dethatch if heavy thatch
- First PGF Complete when green haze appears

### Spring
- Overseeding possible (more water needed)
- Grub treatment
- Fungicide (preventative or curative)
- Aeration, leveling, dethatching during active growth
- DirtBooster when temps hit high 70s+

### Summer
- LIGHT feeding only (Green Shocker, Super Juice)
- No strong slow-release fertilizers
- Watch for disease - treat as needed
- Raise cutting height 0.5" - 1"
- Spoon feeding only - before rain, avoid drought stress
- Do NOT let lawn completely dry out for extended periods

### Late Summer/Early Fall
- Watch for armyworms
- Treat for grubs (late summer/early fall)
- Resume slow-release PGF Complete when temps drop to high 70s
- Lower cutting height back to normal
- Primary seeding/aeration window

### Fall into Late Fall
- Slow-release fertilizer should carry through
- Add PGF Balance 10-10-10 for last treatment
- Apply winter pre-emergent as temps really drop

## Common Issues

### Yellow Blades (Chlorosis)
**Causes**: Overwatering, high phosphorus, PH imbalance
**Quick fix**: Super Juice spray + extra liquid iron
**Long fix**: Soil test to identify root cause

### Fungus (Dollar Spot, Brown Patch)
- Common during slow growth periods (summer stress)
- Prevention: Granular fungicide when temps hit 80s
- Treatment: Follow label, may need to rotate chemicals

### Grubs
- Signs: Brown patches that pull up easy, crows feeding
- Treatment: Duocide granules at heavy rate, water in deeply
- Timing: Spring and late summer/early fall

### Armyworms
- Feed on blades (surface pests)
- Signs: Thinned-out appearance, moth activity
- Treatment: Duocide or hose-end lawn pest spray
