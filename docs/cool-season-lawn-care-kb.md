# Cool-Season Grass — Complete Knowledge Base

Covers: **Tall Fescue**, **Kentucky Bluegrass (KBG)**, **Perennial Ryegrass**

---

## Section 1: Grass Profile
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Tall Fescue

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Cool-season perennial |
| **Growth method** | Tillers only (non-spreading, clump-forming) |
| **Cutting height** | 2.5–4 in |
| **Drought tolerance** | Good |
| **Traffic tolerance** | Good |
| **Heat tolerance** | Good (improved varieties for transition zones) |
| **Shade tolerance** | Moderate (some varieties slightly shade-tolerant) |
| **Sun preference** | Full sun |
| **Blade type** | Flat, slightly wider |
| **Planting method** | Seed (also sod) |
| **Ease of care** | One of the easiest cool-season grasses |
| **N requirement** | Moderate |
| **Thatch production** | Moderate |
| **Key note** | Most common cool-season grass in the US. Avoid K-31 pasture-type (coarse blade, pale color). Many fescue sods contain ~10% KBG. |

### Kentucky Bluegrass (KBG)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Cool-season perennial |
| **Growth method** | Tillers AND rhizomes (one of few cool-season grasses that actively spreads) |
| **Cutting height** | 2–3 in (sod-grade: as low as 0.25 in with reel mower) |
| **Drought tolerance** | Moderate (goes semi-dormant in extreme heat/drought; recovers when cooler temps + moisture return) |
| **Traffic tolerance** | High |
| **Heat tolerance** | Moderate (improved varieties available for transition zones) |
| **Cold tolerance** | High |
| **Shade tolerance** | Low — prefers well-drained, sunny areas |
| **Blade type** | Fine to medium |
| **Planting method** | Seed or sod |
| **N requirement** | Higher: 2–4 lb N per 1,000 sq ft per growing season |
| **Thatch production** | Significant |
| **Key note** | Many grades and varieties. Smaller seeds = more seeds per pound than fescue. Recovers from drought unless severe. |

### Perennial Ryegrass

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Cool-season perennial |
| **Growth method** | Tillers only (non-spreading, clump-forming) |
| **Cutting height** | 1.5–2.5 in (sod-grade: down to 0.5 in with reel mower) |
| **Drought tolerance** | Low |
| **Traffic tolerance** | Good |
| **Heat tolerance** | Good |
| **Shade tolerance** | Poor |
| **Blade type** | Fine to medium, dark green |
| **Planting method** | Seed (also sod) |
| **Germination** | Rapid — excellent for overseeding |
| **N requirement** | Moderate |
| **Thatch production** | Low [INFERRED] |
| **Key note** | Can be competitive with other grasses. Typically ~20% in blends with KBG or fine fescues. Many varieties available. |

### Fine Fescue (Shade Specialist)

| Attribute | Fine Fescue | Tall Fescue |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Blade | Very fine, soft | Flat, slightly wider |
| Shade tolerance | Better (esp. Chewings & Creeping Red) | Moderate |
| Drought tolerance | Less | Good |
| Wear tolerance | Less | Good |
| Color | Not as dark green | Good green |
| Hot/sunny areas | Performs poorly | Performs well |
| Recommendation | Shade areas only | General lawn |

### Mixing & Blending

- Pick ONE grass type first. Use mixing/blending as a FIX for problems.
- Common mixes: KBG + Perennial Ryegrass (drought tolerance + disease resistance); Fescue blends (3 improved varieties for your zone).
- Do NOT mix shade-tolerant grasses into full-sun areas. Treat small shady areas separately.

### Grass Plant Anatomy

All cool-season grasses have: leaves, roots, crowns, tillers. KBG also has rhizomes for spreading. Most cool-season grasses do NOT actively spread like warm-season grasses.

## Section 2: Mowing
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Height Guidelines by Grass Type

| Grass Type | Ideal Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Tall Fescue | 2.5–4 in | Raise 0.5–1 in taller in summer |
| Kentucky Bluegrass | 2–3 in | Sod-grade: as low as 0.25 in (reel mower) |
| Perennial Ryegrass | 1.5–2.5 in | Sod-grade: down to 0.5 in (reel mower) |
| Shady areas (any type) | Raise height | Taller grass catches more sunlight |

### Mower Types

| Feature | Rotary Mower | Reel Mower |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Best for | Majority of cool-season lawns (lifts and cuts longer blades) | Lawns cut below 1 in |
| Performance on long grass | Good | Poor |

### Key Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Blade sharpness | Keep blades sharp — buy extras and rotate. Dull blades rip and tear. |
| Frequency | Cut MORE often, take LESS off each time |
| Never | Let lawn overgrow then cut way down |
| Growing season | Mow every week minimum |
| Peak growth | May need every 2–3 days |
| Very short lawns (0.5 in) | Every 2–3 days |
| Early spring cleanup | Cut dead grass LOW, bag it and remove from lawn |

---

## Section 3: Watering
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Established Lawns

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Weekly target | 1 inch of water per week |
| Strategy | Water deeper, less often |
| Avoid | Keeping lawn wet all the time (causes fungus and chlorosis) |
| Cycle | Deep watering → allow to dry out |

### New Lawns / Newly Seeded / Newly Sodded

| Phase | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| First few weeks | Short waterings 2–3x per day |
| Newly established | Every other day |
| During heat | 3–4x per week |

### Hot Spots

Areas over tree roots or construction debris dry out 5x faster. May need hand watering.

---

## Section 4: Fertilization
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Recommended Ratio (Without Soil Test)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Ratio | **4-1-2** (N-P-K) |
| Example products | 16-4-8 (4-1-2), 32-8-16 (4-1-2), 15-5-10 (3-1-2) |
| Primary fertilizer | PGF Complete 16-4-8 — mild slow release, tiny particles, contains iron + micronutrients + Humic DG |
| Application frequency | Every 3–8 weeks during growing season |

### Why NOT Organic for Primary Feeding (Cool Season)

Organic fertilizers require warm temps for microbial breakdown. Cool-season feeding targets cooler weather — timing mismatch. Use chemical/direct-nutrient fertilizers (PGF Complete) for primary feeding. Organics OK in warmer months as supplement.

### When to Vary Fertilizer

| Reason | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Soil test shows excess or deficiency | e.g., PGF Balance 10-10-10 for low phosphorus; PGF 16-0-8 for high phosphorus |
| Seasonal timing | Higher N during green-up (late spring), lower N in late fall |

### Spoon Feeding (Summer)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| What | Small, frequent supplemental feedings instead of strong slow-release |
| Why | Avoids growth surge during heat stress |
| Products | Super Juice (liquid), Green Shocker (mild fast-release) |
| Conditions | Not in drought; have irrigation or rain approaching; haven't recently applied strong slow-release |
| Iron benefit | Often includes iron for darker green color |

### Fertilizer Myths

| Myth | Truth |
|------|-------|
| "I'm feeding my plants" | You feed the SOIL. The plant draws what it needs. |
| "More nutrient X = better growth" | Plants only need a threshold. Excess can cause harm (e.g., high phosphorus locks up other nutrients). |

### Winterizing

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| General rule | If you followed the program (16-4-8 or 16-0-8 through the year), you probably don't need to winterize |
| Potassium role | Enhances cold tolerance — only supplement if soil test shows LOW potassium |
| Rate | 1 lb potash per 1,000 sq ft |
| Warnings | Excessive K causes foliar burn, competes with other nutrients, affects magnesium uptake (lighter green), can increase disease susceptibility |

### Supplements (Not Base Fertilizers)

| Product | Type | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| Super Juice | Liquid supplement | Summer spoon feeding, green-up |
| Green Shocker | Mild fast-release supplement | Summer spoon feeding, green-up, anytime boost |

---

## Section 5: Seasonal Care Calendar
<!-- complexity: simple -->

*Months vary greatly by geographic area. Adjust to your zone.*

### Winter (Lawn Dormant)

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Lawn status | Asleep / dormant — nothing to do to the grass |
| pH adjustment | Heavy lime applications (if needed) — no snow on ground |
| Carbon / Biochar | Apply HumiChar — carbon takes a long time to work into soil; starting now = deeper penetration by spring |

### Late Winter / Very Early Spring

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Pre-emergent | Apply to established lawns; better 2 weeks BEFORE target date |
| PE soil temp trigger | 51–53 F |
| Jump Start program | Apply PGF Balance 10-10-10 at same time as pre-emergent |
| Jump Start rationale | Soil is a "post-winter wasteland" — nutrients leached, microbes gone. Inject mild nutrients for grass wake-up WITHOUT heavy nitrogen |
| Cleanup | Remove dead leaves and yard waste |

### Early Spring

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Mowing | Cut dead grass LOW. Bag it and remove from lawn |
| Dethatching | Light dethatch if heavy thatch layer |
| Base fertilizer | When green haze covers entire lawn → apply PGF Complete 16-4-8 |

### Spring

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Overseeding | CAN be done (understand: new seed needs more irrigation before summer) |
| Grub killer | Apply (late spring timing) |
| Fungicide | Curative or preventative — granular (Prophesy) as weather warms |
| Dethatching | Can continue |
| Aeration | Can begin once grass is growing and healthy |
| Leveling | Can begin once grass is growing and healthy |
| Organic matter | Apply Dirt Booster when daytime temps reach high 70s+ |

### Summer

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Disease watch | Monitor and treat |
| Fertilizer | NO strong slow-release. Switch to light supplemental feedings (Green Shocker, Super Juice) |
| Feeding timing | Apply just before rain events. Avoid during long droughts |
| Mowing height | Raise 0.5–1 in taller than spring cut |
| Watering | Don't let lawn totally dry out for extended periods (may go summer dormant) |

### Late Summer / Early Fall

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Armyworms | Watch for and treat |
| Grubs | Second treatment (Duocide) |
| Supplements | Green Shocker until temps fall into high 70s |
| Base fertilizer | Switch back to slow-release PGF Complete when temps drop |
| Mowing height | Return to normal |
| Aeration | Primary time for cool-season lawns |
| Seeding | Primary overseeding / seeding window |
| Pre-emergent conflict | Do NOT apply pre-emergent if you plan to seed |

### Fall into Late Fall

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Fertilizer | Slow release should hold. Optional: fast-release like Green Shocker |
| Final feeding | Light coat of PGF Balance 10-10-10 as cold approaches |
| Winter pre-emergent | Apply when temps really drop and growth totally stops |

---

## Section 6: Weed Control
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Principles

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Avoid | Granular weed-killing products and "weed and feed" combos — they don't work well |
| Prefer | Liquid weed killers |
| Temperature | Most weed killers: do NOT apply above 85 F or during heat stress |
| Always | Read the label |

### Pre-Emergent Program (Split — 2 Steps)

| Step | Type | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| Step 1 | Granular DG pre-emergent | Dispersible granule breaks into 1,000s of sub-particles |
| Step 2 | Spray pre-emergent | Also has POST-emergent killing effect on young crabgrass that broke through Step 1 |

### Pre-Emergent Timing

| Window | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Spring | Soil temp reaches 51–53 F (ideally apply 2 weeks early) |
| Winter | Late fall when growth totally stops |

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT apply pre-emergent if you plan to seed.

---

## Section 7: Pest Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### Two Most Common Pests

| Pest | What It Eats | Damage Pattern | Origin |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| White Grubs | Roots (2–6 in deep) | Medium to large brown patches that pull up easily | Beetles |
| Armyworms | Grass blades (surface) | Surface damage, rapid | Moth eggs |

### Treatment Schedule

| Timing | Window |
|--------|--------|
| Treatment 1 | Late spring (Pope: last week of May) |
| Treatment 2 | Late summer / early fall (Pope: 2nd week Aug to 1st week Sept) |

### Products

| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Duocide Granules (Andersons) | Primary — spread on lawn, water in. Kills grubs, mole crickets, armyworms, ants, fleas, ticks |
| Hose-end lawn pest spray (e.g., Bayer) | Add-on for heavy armyworm infestations |

**Pope's application note:** Duocide at 4 lb rate.

---

## Section 8: Disease Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### When Fungus Appears

Usually during slower growth / summer stress months.

### Prevention

Apply granular fungicide (Prophesy by Andersons) in spring as weather warms. DG particles provide superior coverage + longer lasting than most sprays.

### Treatment Protocol

1. Apply Prophesy at bag rate (up to 3 times)
2. SWITCH to BioAdvanced spray product (fungus develops resistance to a single product)
3. Rotate chemicals to prevent resistance

### Chlorosis (Yellow Blades) [INFERRED — expanded from watering section]

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Overwatering | Reduce irrigation — established lawns should NOT be kept wet constantly |
| High phosphorus | Soil test; switch to zero-P fertilizer (16-0-8) |
| pH locking up iron | Spray Super Juice + liquid iron; correct pH with lime or sulfur |

---

## Section 9: Soil & pH
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Core Principle

When you add fertilizer, supplements, or organic matter to your lawn, you are adding it to the SOIL, not directly to the plant. Healthy soil = great lawns. Think of lawn soil as a bank for nutrients. **Step #1: Get a soil test.**

### Soil Testing

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Recommended lab | Clemson University (or your local extension office) |
| Two critical factors | Phosphorus level + pH level |
| Approach (Doc) | Don't "read too much" into the report — focus on wild spikes and pH |
| Approach (Pope) | Use the same quality testing lab year after year (standards vary between labs) |

### Soil pH

| pH Value | Classification |
|----------|---------------|
| < 7.0 | Acidic |
| 7.0 | Neutral |
| > 7.0 | Alkaline |
| **~6.5** | **Ideal for most lawn grasses** |

**Why it matters:** When pH gets too high or too low, certain nutrients get locked up in the soil or are depleted easily.

### Raising pH (Acidic Soil → Apply Lime)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Product | Crushed lime or pelletized lime |
| Rate | 50–100 lbs per 1,000 sq ft to raise pH ONE point |
| Example | 20,000 sq ft lawn = up to 40 bags (40 lb each) — pay for pallet delivery |
| Fast-acting lime | Works quicker, fewer long-lasting impacts |
| Standard lime | Takes longer, lasts much longer |

### Lowering pH (Alkaline Soil → Apply Sulfur)

Products: elemental/ground sulfur, iron sulfate, aluminum sulfate. Available at garden centers.

### Carbon & Biochar (HumiChar)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Composition | 50% biochar + 50% humic acid (pelletized) |
| Benefits | Improves poor soils, holds nutrients, creates good microbe environment, lasts decades, reduces long-term fertilizer need |
| What it is NOT | Not a nutrient — it's a soil structure improvement |

### Adding Organic Matter

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| When | Soil temps 65 F+ (microbes and fungi need warmth) |
| Why | Soil microbes and mycorrhizal fungi are critical for lawn health. Both need quality organic matter. |
| Product | Dirt Booster — contains corn distillates, molasses, biochar, humic acid. Includes microbe and fungus booster spray pack. |
| Application | Spread with spreader → spray with booster pack. Apply when temps above 80 F, as often as desired. |
| Bonus | Increasing good microbes and fungus helps reduce thatch buildup. |

### Measuring Lawn Square Footage

Google Maps satellite view → right-click corners → "Measure Distance" → creates polygon → shows sq ft at bottom.

## Section 10: Establishment
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Seeding

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Best timing | **FALL** (roots develop before summer heat) |
| Spring overseeding | Can work with good results, especially with irrigation |
| Planting depth | Shallow — 1/8 to 1/2 in in soil |
| Scarifying | Doc recommends scarifying lawn after spreading seed |
| Germination | Cool-season seeds germinate quickly, lawns establish fast |
| Seeding rates | Vary greatly between varieties and new lawn vs. overseeding. KBG has more seeds per pound (smaller seeds) than tall fescue. Always check bag label. |

### Seeding Rates by Grass Type [INFERRED]

| Grass Type | New Lawn | Overseeding |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Tall Fescue | 6–8 lbs per 1,000 sq ft | 3–4 lbs per 1,000 sq ft |
| Kentucky Bluegrass | 2–3 lbs per 1,000 sq ft | 1–2 lbs per 1,000 sq ft |
| Perennial Ryegrass | 6–8 lbs per 1,000 sq ft | 3–4 lbs per 1,000 sq ft |

### Advantages of Cool Season

Seeds germinate quickly, lawns establish fast (vs. Bermuda or Zoysia). Easy to blend types or kill off and reseed entirely.

**Pope's note:** If your cool-season lawn isn't performing well, consider introducing diversity where the primary species isn't performing.

### Aeration

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| When | During strong growing period (for recovery and fill-in) |
| Purpose | Relieves soil compaction; allows water and oxygen deep into soil |
| Prep | Cut lawn fairly short first — hard to pick up plugs otherwise |
| Best season | Late summer / early fall for cool-season grasses |

### Dethatching

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Healthy thatch | ~0.5 in layer is fine |
| Short lawns (0.25–1 in) | Seldom need it — small clippings decompose quickly |
| Long cool-season lawns | Often get excess buildup |
| Tool | Spring tine dethatcher — pulls up dead grass; rake it up |
| Timing | Late winter / early spring cleanup OR during growing season |

### Leveling

| Form | Method |
|------|--------|
| Spot leveling | Larger ruts/bumps → quality soil with organic matter + reseed |
| Minor overall leveling | Leveling mix/sand for smooth lawn |

**Rules:** Must be done during active growing season. Cut grass as short as possible first — you're leveling the GROUND, not the grass.

### Rolling

**Verdict: Don't bother** with consumer-grade water/sand-filled rollers. Insufficient pressure. Exception: commercial companies with small pavement rollers can be effective on frost heave.

## Section 11: Troubleshooting Decision Trees
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### "What grass should I plant?"

1. Full sun, easy care, most common? → **Tall Fescue** (3 improved varieties for your zone)
2. Want a grass that spreads and self-repairs? → **Kentucky Bluegrass** (higher N and maintenance)
3. Need rapid germination or overseeding? → **Perennial Ryegrass**
4. Shady areas? → **Fine Fescue** (Chewings or Creeping Red) — shade areas only
5. Transition zone with heat stress? → Improved Tall Fescue or improved KBG varieties
6. Best practice: pick ONE type in a mix of 3 improved varieties for your zone
7. Do NOT mix shade-tolerant grasses into full-sun areas

### "My lawn has brown patches"

1. **Pull test:** grass lifts easily? → Likely **GRUBS** (check 2–6 in deep for white worms)
2. **Doesn't lift?** → Likely **FUNGUS** (brown patch or dollar spot)
3. Grubs → Duocide at heavy rate + water in deeply
4. Fungus → Prophesy fungicide at bag rate; rotate to BioAdvanced spray after 3 applications
5. Recovery: apply PGF Complete after treating; ~6 weeks to heal [INFERRED]
6. If neither: check watering (dry spots over tree roots or debris? → hand water those areas)

### "What's the best fertilizer?"

1. No soil test? → Use **4-1-2 ratio** (e.g., PGF Complete 16-4-8)
2. Soil test shows high phosphorus? → Switch to PGF 16-0-8
3. Soil test shows low phosphorus? → Use PGF Balance 10-10-10
4. Summer? → NO strong slow-release. Use Super Juice or Green Shocker (spoon feeding)
5. Late winter Jump Start? → PGF Balance 10-10-10 alongside pre-emergent
6. Avoid "weed and feed" combos and specialty starter fertilizers

### "Should I fertilize in summer?"

1. YES — but with caveats (spoon feeding only)
2. NO strong slow-release fertilizers (causes growth surge during stress → damage)
3. Use **Super Juice** (liquid) or **Green Shocker** (mild fast-release)
4. Apply just before rain events
5. Do NOT apply during long droughts without irrigation
6. Make sure you haven't recently applied strong slow-release

### "What do I do this month?"

→ See **Section 5: Seasonal Care Calendar** — match current season to task list. Adjust months for your geographic area.

### "When to put down pre-emergent?"

1. **Spring:** Soil temp reaches 51–53 F (apply 2 weeks early if possible)
2. Step 1: Granular DG pre-emergent (long-lasting barrier)
3. Step 2: Spray pre-emergent (also has post-emergent effect on young crabgrass)
4. **Winter/Fall:** Apply in late fall when growth totally stops
5. **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT apply pre-emergent if you plan to seed

### "My grass is yellow" [INFERRED]

1. Check watering — overwatering causes chlorosis (yellowing)
2. Check pH — high pH locks up iron in the soil
3. Check fertilizer — high phosphorus? Switch to zero-P fertilizer (16-0-8)
4. Quick fix: spray Super Juice + liquid iron
5. Long-term fix: get a soil test → correct pH → adjust fertilizer program

### "When do I start in spring?" [INFERRED]

1. Soil temps at 51–53 F → Apply pre-emergent (ideally 2 weeks early)
2. Same time → Jump Start: PGF Balance 10-10-10 + HumiChar
3. Remove dead leaves and yard waste
4. Green haze covers lawn → Cut dead grass low, bag it, light dethatch
5. Full green haze → Apply PGF Complete 16-4-8 (base fertilizer)
6. Late spring → Grub killer, begin aeration/leveling, apply fungicide as weather warms
