- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-short-to-cut-grass/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/when-to-cut-new-grass/

### Key Facts

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| One-third rule | Never cut more than 1/3 of grass height per mow |
| When to mow | Mow when grass is 50% taller than ideal height |
| Mowing frequency | Typically once per week during active growth; may need twice/week in peak spring |
| New grass | Wait until new grass reaches mowing height before first cut |
| Blade sharpness | Sharpen mower blades at least once per season; dull blades tear grass and invite disease |
| Clippings | Leave clippings on the lawn (grasscycling) — they return nitrogen to soil |
| Direction | Alternate mowing direction each time to prevent grain and soil compaction |
| Wet grass | Avoid mowing wet grass — leads to uneven cuts and clumping |

### Mowing Heights by Grass Type

| Grass Type | Ideal Height (inches) |
|------------|----------------------|
| Bermuda | 1-2 |
| Zoysia | 1-2.5 |
| St. Augustine | 2.5-4 |
| Tall Fescue | 2.5-4 |
| Kentucky Bluegrass | 2-3 |
| Perennial Ryegrass | 1.5-2.5 |
| Fine Fescue | 2.5-4 |

### Common Mowing Mistakes
- Cutting too short (scalping) — stresses grass and invites weeds
- Mowing on a set schedule vs. by growth — grass grows at different rates by season
- Not raising mow height in summer — raise 0.5-1 inch during heat stress
- Mowing when lawn is wet
- Using dull blades
- Always mowing the same direction

- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-often-water-grass-seed/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/when-best-time-to-water-your-lawn-in-hot-weather/

### Key Facts

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Cool-season water needs | 1-1.5 inches per week |
| Warm-season water needs | 0.5-1 inch per week |
| Frequency | 2-3 times per week in equally spaced intervals |
| Session length | 20-30 minutes per session |
| Best time | 5-9 AM (less evaporation, less wind, dries before nightfall) |
| Deep vs. shallow | Deep, infrequent watering encourages deep root growth |
| Measurement | Use a tuna can or rain gauge to measure sprinkler output |
| New seed | Keep moist with light frequent watering (5-10 min, 2-3 times daily) until established |
| Summer | May need to increase depth; water 2-3 times per week between June-August |

### Watering Mistakes to Avoid
- Watering at night — promotes fungal disease
- Shallow, daily watering — creates weak, shallow root systems
- Ignoring rainfall — skip watering after rain
- Overwatering — leads to root rot, fungus, and thatch buildup

- https://lawnlove.com/blog/best-weed-and-feeds/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-to-use-weed-and-feed/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/fertilizing-new-grass/

### Key Facts

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| NPK | Nitrogen (N) = leafy growth + green color; Phosphorus (P) = root development; Potassium (K) = disease resistance + stress tolerance |
| Standard rate | ~1 lb nitrogen per 1,000 sqft per application |
| Cool-season timing | Fertilize in early spring and fall (primary growth periods) |
| Warm-season timing | Fertilize late spring through summer (active growth) |
| Spreader types | Broadcast (rotary) for large areas; drop spreader for precision near beds |
| Granular vs. liquid | Granular = slower release, longer lasting; Liquid = faster absorption, quicker green-up |
| New grass | Use starter fertilizer (high phosphorus) before seeding or sodding |
| Over-fertilization signs | Burnt/yellowed tips, excessive growth, brown streaks from spreader overlap |

### NPK Ratios by Grass Type
| Grass Type | Recommended Ratio |
|------------|------------------|
| Tall Fescue | 4-1-2 (e.g., 16-4-8) |
| St. Augustine | 3-1-2 or 4-1-3 |
| Centipede | 15-0-15 |
| Bermuda | 3-1-2 or 4-1-2 |
| KBG | High nitrogen (4-1-2) |

### Weed and Feed
- Combination products that fertilize while controlling broadleaf weeds
- Apply when weeds are actively growing and temperatures are between 60-85°F
- Do not apply to newly seeded lawns
- Water lawn 24 hours before application so weeds are moist and granules stick

---

## 4. Aeration

**Sources:**
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/why-when-and-how-to-aerate-your-lawn/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-to-aerate-lawn/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/core-or-spike-aeration/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-to-aerate-a-lawn-by-hand/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-to-prepare-lawn-for-aeration-and-overseeding/

### Key Facts

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Core aeration | Pulls soil plugs (preferred method); plugs act as natural topdressing |
| Spike aeration | Pokes holes but can worsen compaction; only for mildly compacted lawns |
| Cool-season timing | Late summer to early fall |
| Warm-season timing | Late spring to early summer |
| Soil condition | Aerate when soil is moist but not saturated |
| Frequency | Once per year for most lawns; high-traffic areas may need twice |
| Plug depth | 2-3 inches deep, 2-3 inches apart |
| After aeration | Leave plugs on lawn to decompose; combine with overseeding and topdressing |

### Benefits of Aeration
- Relieves soil compaction
- Improves water, nutrient, and oxygen penetration to roots
- Reduces thatch buildup
- Promotes deeper root growth
- Creates ideal conditions for overseeding

## 5. Overseeding

**Sources:**
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-to-overseed-lawn/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/best-time-to-aerate-and-overseed-a-lawn/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/overseeding-mistakes/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/overseeding-in-spring/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/what-is-overseeding/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-long-after-overseeding-can-mow/

### Key Facts

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Cool-season timing | Late summer to early fall (warm soil + cool nights = best germination) |
| Warm-season timing | Late spring to early summer |
| Pre-emergent conflict | Do NOT apply pre-emergent 8-12 weeks before overseeding |
| Seed rate | Follow label rate; too much seed causes competition |
| Mowing after | Wait until new grass is 3-4 inches tall before first mow |

### Step-by-Step Process
1. Mow existing grass low (1 inch or shorter)
2. Dethatch to remove dead material blocking seed-to-soil contact
3. Aerate to create holes for seeds
4. Spread seed at label rate (two passes at half rate for even coverage)
5. Apply starter fertilizer
6. Water consistently — keep soil moist but not soaked

### Top Overseeding Mistakes
- Seeding too early in spring (freeze risk + pre-emergent conflict)
- Skipping dethatching/aeration (poor seed-to-soil contact)
- Using too much seed (overcrowding)
- Not watering consistently after seeding
- Mowing too soon after germination

## 6. Dethatching

**Sources:**
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/what-is-dethatching/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-to-dethatch-lawn/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/when-to-dethatch-lawn/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/benefits-dethatching-lawn/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/when-spring-dethatching-destroys-lawn/

### Key Facts

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| What is thatch | Dead grass, roots, and debris between soil and living grass |
| Healthy thatch | < 0.5 inch — protects roots and retains moisture |
| Problem thatch | > 0.5 inch — blocks water, air, and nutrients from roots |
| Cool-season timing | Early fall or early spring (during active growth) |
| Warm-season timing | Late spring to early summer |
| Methods | Manual rake (light thatch), power dethatcher (heavy thatch), vertical mower (severe) |
| Pre-dethatching | Water lawn 1-2 days before so thatch pulls up easily but soil stays intact |

### Warning: Spring Dethatching Risks
- Dethatching too early in spring (before active growth) can destroy a lawn
- Never dethatch dormant, stressed, or drought-stricken grass
- Dethatching creates open soil that weeds can colonize — plan to overseed or apply pre-emergent after

- https://lawnlove.com/blog/when-and-how-to-apply-pre-emergent-herbicides/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/what-are-pre-emergent-herbicides/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/why-pre-emergent-didnt-work/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/best-pre-emergent-herbicides/

### Key Facts

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Spring timing | Apply when soil temp reaches 55°F for several consecutive days |
| Fall timing | Apply when soil temp drops to 70°F (Aug-Oct by region) |
| Duration | Most last 8-12 weeks |
| Seeding conflict | Do NOT apply if planning to seed within 8-12 weeks |
| Southern vs. Northern | Southern regions apply earlier than northern |
| Soil temp check | Use greencastonline.com or soil thermometer at 4-inch depth |

### Why Pre-Emergent Fails (7 Common Reasons)
1. Applied too late (weeds already germinated)
2. Applied too early (product breaks down before weed germination)
3. Not watered in within 24-48 hours after application
4. Applied unevenly (missed spots with spreader)
5. Thatch layer too thick (prevents product from reaching soil)
6. Wrong product for target weed
7. Product degraded by heavy rain or extreme heat

- https://lawnlove.com/blog/complete-guide-different-soil-types/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-earthworms-help-lawn-soil/

### Soil pH

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Ideal range | 6.0-7.0 for most grasses |
| KBG / Bermuda | Prefer 6.0-6.5 |
| Testing | Soil test kit from garden center or county extension office |
| Raise pH (acidic soil) | Apply lime, wood ash, or oyster shell meal |
| Lime rate | Max 50 lbs/1,000 sqft per application |
| Lime timing | Apply in fall for maximum reaction time; takes 2-3 months to adjust |
| Lower pH (alkaline soil) | Apply elemental sulfur, aluminum sulfate, or iron sulfate |
| Sulfur rate | 0.5-1.0 lbs/1,000 sqft per 0.5 pH point desired |
| Sandy soil | Needs less amendment than clay soil |
| Retest | Always retest 3 months after amendments |

### Soil Types
| Type | Characteristics | Lawn Implications |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Sandy | Drains fast, low nutrients | Water and fertilize more frequently |
| Clay | Drains slow, compacts easily | Aerate regularly, amend with comite |
| Loam | Balanced drainage and nutrients | Ideal for most grasses |
| Silt | Smooth, compacts when wet | Improve drainage, aerate |

### Earthworms
- Beneficial for lawn soil — their tunnels aerate soil and improve drainage
- Castings (worm poop) are nutrient-rich natural fertilizer
- Healthy earthworm population indicates healthy soil
- Avoid pesticides that harm earthworm populations

### Pest Reference

| Pest | ID | Damage | Season | Treatment |
|------|----|--------|--------|-----------|
| White grubs | C-shaped, milky white, 1-2", brown head | Brown patches that peel up like carpet (root damage) | Late spring-fall | Preventative: chlorantraniliprole (late spring); Curative: trichlorfon (late summer). Treat if 6+ per sqft |
| Armyworms | Green/brown caterpillars with stripes, 1-1.5" | Consume grass blades rapidly, can destroy lawn in days | Late summer (some as early as April) | Bifenthrin or carbaryl at first sign |
| Chinch bugs | 1/6" black with white wings | Pierce stems, inject phytotoxin; yellowing patches unresponsive to water | Summer (hot, dry) | Bifenthrin |
| Sod webworms | 1" greenish-brown larvae | Eat grass at night; ragged, thinning turf | Summer | Bifenthrin or carbaryl |
| Mole crickets | 1-2" brown, cricket-like with shovel-like front legs | Tunnel through soil, damage roots | Spring-fall | Bifenthrin bait or nematodes |
| Voles | Small rodents, 3-5" | Surface runways 1-2" wide, gnaw marks at grass base | Fall-winter | Habitat reduction, traps, castor oil repellent |

### Pests by Grass Type
- **St. Augustine**: Chinch bugs (primary), sod webworms, grubs, mole crickets
- **Zoysia**: Grubs, billbugs, hunting billbug, mole crickets, armyworms
- **Bermuda**: Armyworms, grubs, mole crickets, Bermuda mites
- **Cool-season (general)**: Grubs, armyworms, sod webworms, chinch bugs

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach
1. Cultural controls: proper mowing, watering, and fertilization (healthy lawns resist pests)
2. Biological controls: beneficial nematodes, milky spore for grubs, Bt for caterpillars
3. Mechanical controls: hand-removal, traps
4. Chemical controls: targeted pesticides as last resort; spot-treat vs. broadcast
5. Monitor: regular lawn inspections, soap flush test for surface pests

### Pesticide Safety
- Always read and follow product labels
- Wear protective equipment (gloves, long sleeves, eye protection)
- Apply when wind is calm (< 10 mph)
- Keep pets and children off treated areas for period specified on label
- Store products in original containers away from children
- Do not apply near water sources or storm drains

- https://lawnlove.com/blog/how-to-grow-sod/

### Warm-Season vs. Cool-Season Summary

| Attribute | Warm-Season | Cool-Season |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Active growth | Spring-summer (75-90°F) | Spring + fall (60-75°F) |
| Dormancy | Winter (turns brown) | Summer stress (may thin/brown) |
| Primary seeding window | Late spring-early summer | Late summer-early fall |
| Water needs | 0.5-1 inch/week | 1-1.5 inches/week |
| Examples | Bermuda, Zoysia, St. Augustine, Centipede, Bahia | Tall Fescue, KBG, Perennial Ryegrass, Fine Fescue |
| Best regions | South, Southeast, Southwest | North, Northeast, Midwest, Pacific NW |
| Transition zone | Both may be used; Tall Fescue and Zoysia popular | |

### Lawn Scalping
- Cutting grass extremely short (down to 0.5-1 inch) to remove dead material
- Primarily done for warm-season grasses in early spring before green-up
- Promotes faster green-up by exposing soil to sunlight
- Do NOT scalp cool-season grasses — they don't recover the same way

### Growing Sod
- Prep soil: till, level, add starter fertilizer
- Lay sod in a staggered brick pattern with tight seams
- Water immediately after installation — soak 1 inch
- Keep sod moist for first 2 weeks (water daily)
- First mow after 2-3 weeks when sod is rooted (tug test)
- Avoid heavy traffic for 3-4 weeks

- https://lawnlove.com/blog/lawn-care-calendar-warm-season-grass/
- https://lawnlove.com/blog/expert-tips-for-healthy-lawn/

### Spring Lawn Care (12 Essential Steps)
1. Rake/clean debris from lawn
2. Test soil pH and nutrients
3. Apply lime if soil is acidic
4. Dethatch if thatch > 0.5 inch
5. Aerate compacted areas
6. Apply pre-emergent when soil hits 55°F
7. Overseed thin spots (cool-season only in early spring; better in fall)
8. Apply first fertilizer application
9. Begin mowing when grass is actively growing
10. Set mower to proper height
11. Start watering schedule (if no rain)
12. Monitor for early pest/disease signs

### Summer Lawn Care
- Raise mowing height 0.5-1 inch to shade roots
- Water deeply 2-3 times per week (early morning)
- Avoid heavy fertilization (spoon-feed light applications only)
- Watch for disease (brown patch, dollar spot) in hot/humid weather
- Monitor for pests (grubs, armyworms, chinch bugs)
- Stay off stressed/dormant grass as much as possible

### Fall Lawn Care
- PRIMARY overseeding window for cool-season grasses
- Aerate and overseed
- Apply fall fertilizer (most important application of the year for cool-season)
- Apply fall pre-emergent for winter weeds (soil temp drops to 70°F)
- Continue mowing until grass stops growing
- Gradually lower mowing height for final cut
- Clean up leaves — smothering grass leads to disease

### Winter Lawn Care
- Warm-season: grass is dormant — avoid traffic, no mowing needed
- Cool-season: minimal maintenance, apply lime for pH correction
- Sharpen mower blades and service equipment
- Plan for spring by ordering supplies
