# Zoysia — Complete Knowledge Base

---

## Section 1: Grass Profile
<!-- complexity: simple -->

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Warm-season perennial |
| **Growth method** | Rhizomes (underground) + stolons (above-ground); both have NODES (reproductive points); slow grower vs. Bermuda |
| **Ideal temp** | 85–90 F |
| **Dormancy trigger** | Below 50 F (turns brown, still ALIVE — DO NOT use RoundUp or total-kill products) |
| **Sun requirement** | 6-8+ hours full sun/day (better shade tolerance than Bermuda) |
| **Ideal pH** | 6.0–6.5 |
| **Root depth** | Up to 36 inches (most lawns 8-16 in) |
| **Drought tolerance** | Moderate |
| **Traffic tolerance** | Moderate-good |
| **Establishment** | Sod, plugs, seed (limited varieties) |
| **Core promise** | ANYONE can have a great Zoysia lawn. Care is 95% identical to Bermuda with a few key differences. |

### Species & Varieties

| Species | Texture | Cold Tolerance | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Z. japonica | Coarse | Best | Most aggressive; seedable |
| Z. matrella | Medium-fine | Moderate | Sod only |
| Z. tenuifolia | Finest | Least | Sod only, least aggressive |

Care is the same across varieties — only mow height differs. Finer blade = lower cut.
Sod producers give varieties their own brand names based on these species.
Recommended seed: **Zenith Zoysia** (medium blade, up to 12 days germination).

### Zoysia vs. Bermuda (Key Differences)

- Better shade tolerance (6-8 hrs vs 8+)
- Shallower roots (36 in vs 60 in)
- Less brown scalping (blades green further down stalk)
- Slower spreading
- Army worms NOT a major issue (they prefer Bermuda)
- 95% same care program and products
- Mow height slightly different (0.5-2 in vs 0.75-1.5 in)

---

## Section 2: Mowing
<!-- complexity: simple -->

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Growing season height | 0.5–2 in (finer blade = lower) |
| Shade height | Raise 0.5 in |
| Peak frequency | Every 2-3 days |
| Off-peak frequency | Weekly |
| Preferred mower | Reel (McLane 25 in w/ front roller) |
| Rotary minimum | Must reach 0.75 in cut |
| Scalping height (spring) | 50% of desired growing height |
| Doc's cut height | 0.75 in |

Key rules:
- 1/3 rule: never remove more than 1/3 of blade per mow
- Return clippings when mowing frequently
- Alternate mowing direction each cut (horizontal → vertical → diagonals)
- Long Zoysia promotes fungus and bugs — keep it short
- Avoid cutting on wet, soft soil (rut marks)
- Heavy riding mowers can damage Zoysia

### Clippings & Dethatching

- Thatch layer holds moisture — only dethatch if exceeds 0.5 in
- Almost NEVER dethatch warm-season spreading lawns
- Prong-type dethatchers pull up runners → more harm than good
- Better solution: DirtBooster + microbe booster spray
- Last resort only: scalp first, then BLADED dethatcher (Sun Joe AJ801E)
- Golf courses use VERTICUT or Fraze cut

### Spring Scalping

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| When | Full green haze appears; daily temps consistently in 70s (late Mar-early Apr in GA) |
| Target | 50% of desired growing height (e.g., want 1.5 in → scalp to 0.75 in) |
| Tips | Very hard on equipment; bag all dead clippings; can scalp gradually over 4-6 weeks |

---

## Section 3: Watering
<!-- complexity: simple -->

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Weekly need | 1 inch |
| Method | Deep and heavy, not frequent light waterings |
| Best time | Early morning |
| New sod wk 1 | 3x/day |
| New sod wk 2 | 2x/day |
| New sod wk 3 | 1x/day |

Drought protocol: 3+ weeks no rain + 90 F → short cycle program (light waterings morning + late afternoon, 6-9 min/zone)
Hotspots: areas over construction debris, tree roots, septic drains, sand zones — need frequent light waterings
Caution: overwatering → chlorosis (yellowing)

---

## Section 4: Fertilization
<!-- complexity: simple -->

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| NPK ratio (no soil test) | 4-1-2 (PGF Complete 16-4-8) |
| Application rate | 0.58 lbs N/1,000 sqft per app |
| Application frequency | Every 3-6 weeks (growing season) |
| Preferred type | Slow-release (PGF Complete) |
| Supplement spray | Super Juice every 2-3 weeks |
| Quick boost | GreenShocker (results in 3 days) |

Seasonal notes:
- Late winter: PGF Balance 10-10-10 (5 lbs/1,000 sqft) — Jump Start
- Spring-summer: PGF Complete every 3-6 weeks + Super Juice every 2-3 weeks
- Fall: stop granulars → Super Juice only until first frost
- Winter: DO NOT fertilize

### PGF Complete Details

- 3% Iron + micro nutrients + humic acid
- 3 forms of high-quality N; TINY particle size (pro-grade coverage)
- No bio products, waste, sewage, or manures
- Mild enough to stack every 3-6 weeks

### Organic Fertilizers

- Preferred: soy-based (INNOVA) over waste-based
- Cannot burn; adds carbon and amino acids
- Cons: very mild, must be digested by microbes, won't push weak lawns
- **Rule:** Weak/thin lawn = PGF Complete; healthy/thick in summer = organic OK as supplement

### Spray Supplements

| Product | Type | Key Benefit |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Super Juice | Foliar spray (powder + water) | Reaches every blade; iron; humic acid + sea kelp; safe on any lawn including new seed |
| GreenShocker | Fast-release foliar | Results in 3 days; mild enough for summer; any grass type |

**Rule:** Granulars = bulk nutrients + growth. Sprays = mild + overall health.

### Rules

- GET A SOIL TEST (stressed repeatedly for Zoysia)
- Avoid "weed and feed" combos — apply only what's needed
- Avoid "specialty" fertilizers (starter, root builders)

## Section 5: Seasonal Care Calendar
<!-- complexity: simple -->

*Based on daytime high temps. Default: Middle Georgia. Adjust to your zone.*

| Season | Temp Trigger | Key Actions |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Late winter | Soil ~50 F | Soil test; Jump Start: PE + HUMICHAR + PGF 10-10-10 (5 lbs/1K sqft); kill weeds; pH adjust |
| Early spring | Air 70s, green haze | Spring scalp (50% of desired height); 1st PE granular (Andersons Barricade); 2nd PE liquid (Dimension 2EW) |
| Late spring | Air 80s | 1st PGF Complete; begin Super Juice; Prophesy fungicide; aerate + HUMICHAR in holes; begin mowing; level if needed |
| Summer | 85-95 F | PGF Complete every 3-6 wks; Super Juice every 2-3 wks; HUMICHAR; DirtBooster (>80 F); watch bugs/fungus; water; GreenShocker as needed |
| Early fall | Cooling | Feed (PGF Complete); grub treatment (Duocide) — annual rec; watch army worms (rare in Zoysia) |
| Late fall | First cold ~Nov 15 | Stop granulars; Super Juice only until frost; fall PE |
| Winter | Dormant | ALIVE — do NOT use total-kill products; pH adjust; optional green spray dye |

---

## Section 6: Weed Control
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Pre-Emergent (Split Application)

| Application | Timing | Product |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Spring step 1 | Before soil temp 51-53 F | Andersons Barricade (granular DG) |
| Spring step 2 | After scalp/target date | Dimension 2EW (liquid, also kills young crabgrass) |
| Fall | First cold ~Nov 15 | Granular or liquid PE |

Do NOT apply PE to new sod (stops root growth). No PE for 8-12 months on new sod.

**"Pre-Emergent is God's gift to lawn owners." With proper PE → ZERO post-emergent needed.**

### Post-Emergent

| Weed Type | Difficulty | Strategy |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Broadleaf | Easy | Zoysia-safe spray |
| Grassy weeds | Easy | Zoysia-safe spray |
| Crabgrass | Medium | Dimension 2EW has post-emergent on young crabgrass |
| Nutsedge | Medium | PE doesn't control — treat separately (Image Herbicide) |
| Dallisgrass / Goosegrass | Very hard | Spot treat: cloth + RoundUp on plant only |

Winter: wait for warm spell (weed killers need active plants).
Summer/drought: use caution, read labels.

## Section 7: Pest Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

| Pest | Damage Type | Season | Treatment |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| White grubs | Root (underground, 2-6 in) | Spring + late summer | Duocide heavy rate, water in deeply |
| Fall army worms | Blade (surface) | Aug-Sept | NOT a major issue in Zoysia (prefer Bermuda); Duocide or Permethrin if needed |
| Mole crickets | Root tunneling | Spring-fall | Duocide or Permethrin |

Signs: brown patches that pull up easily = grubs; crows/armadillos digging = grubs
Annual recommendation: at least 1 grub treatment/year (especially late summer)
Recovery after treatment: PGF Complete → heals in ~6 weeks
Permethrin note: dog safe, NOT cat safe — used on livestock

Army worm note: "Thank goodness army worms don't LOVE zoysia, they LOVE Bermuda." Doc treats preventatively after seeing moths nearby but finds very few actual worms in Zoysia.

---

## Section 8: Disease Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

| Disease | Appearance | Conditions | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Dollar spot | Small circular patches | Low N, excess moisture | Adequate N, fix irrigation |
| Brown patch | Larger irregular patches | Warm + humid | Prophesy fungicide |
| Anthracnose | Irregular yellowing | Stress + heat | Prophesy fungicide |
| Summer patch | Circular dead areas | Mid-summer heat | Prophesy fungicide |
| Take-all patch | Thinning, weak roots | Acidic soil, moist | Prophesy fungicide |
| Fusarium patch | Variable | Variable | Prophesy fungicide |

Prevention: apply Prophesy (DG Pro granule, 2.5-5.0 lbs/1,000 sqft) when temps hit 80s
Rotation protocol: Prophesy x3 → switch to BioAdvanced spray (prevents resistance)

---

## Section 9: Soil & pH
<!-- complexity: simple -->

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Ideal pH | 6.0–6.5 |
| Raise pH (acidic) | Lime — per bag rate |
| Lower pH (alkaline) | Pelletized sulfur — 5 lbs/1,000 sqft, air temp <75 F |
| pH adjust timing | Preferred: dormant season (can do anytime) |
| Recheck | 3 months after amendment; may take years for large changes |
| Soil test lab | Clemson University (or local extension) |

pH affects nutrient availability, not grass directly. High pH → grass can't access iron.

### HUMICHAR (Soil Amendment)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Composition | 50/50 humic acid + biochar, DG particles |
| Application | Contains NO nutrients; safe anytime, with any product; cannot over-apply |
| Best timing | After aeration — blow particles into holes |
| Humic acid | Works FAST: improves CEC, adds carbon, improves germination, increases microbes |
| Biochar | Works SLOW, lasts DECADES: improves water holding, stimulates microbes, decreases leaching |

CARBON is the "lifeblood of soil." Lawns never get natural decomposition — HUMICHAR replaces missing carbon.

### Adding Organic Matter

- DirtBooster: all-natural compost starter (corn distillates + molasses + biochar + humic acid + microbe booster)
- Apply via spreader → spray with booster pack; temps above 80 F, as often as desired

### Lawn Leveling

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Mix | 70% sand + 30% organic matter (pure sand gets hot in sun) |
| Timing | ONLY during growing season |
| Process | Scalp to ground first; multiple treatments needed |
| Note | Hiring a leveling service is expensive but effective |

---

## Section 10: Establishment
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### From Seed

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Recommended variety | Zenith Zoysia (medium blade) |
| Best timing | Soil temp >65 F (daytime 80s) |
| DO NOT seed | In fall (roots won't develop before dormancy) |
| Seed depth | 1/8 in to 1/2 in |
| Germination | Up to 12 days |
| Pre-seed weed treatment | 3-4 weeks before seeding |
| Pre-emergent hold | No PE for 3-4 months prior |
| Watering | 2-3x daily until germination, then 1x daily 2 weeks |
| First weed killer | Wait 2 months |
| Soil prep | Heavily rake or bladed dethatcher/scarifier; if poor soil, bring in 1-2 in quality topsoil |
| Replacing other grass | Total-kill RoundUp (may take 2 applications for Bermuda/St. Augustine) |

Most fine-blade Zoysia = sod/plugs only. Seed options are medium-blade varieties.
VERY few Zoysia seeds on the market.

### From Sod

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Best timing | Spring-early summer (full growing season ahead) |
| Watering | Wk1: 3x/day → Wk2: 2x/day → Wk3: 1x/day |
| First fertilizer | Light PGF Complete + light Super Juice only |
| Pre-emergent hold | No PE for 8-12 months |
| Year 1 rule | BE GENTLE, BE PATIENT — #1 mistake is doing too much |
| Sod prep | Soil test if time permits; light PGF 10-10-10 a few weeks before + HUMICHAR |
| Full program | Start year 2 |

### Aeration

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Method | CORE PULLING aerator only (NOT spike units) |
| Timing | Late spring to early summer (active growing season) |
| Post-aeration | Heavy HUMICHAR application; blow into holes |
| PE impact | Does NOT ruin pre-emergent treatments (studies confirm) |

## Section 11: Troubleshooting Decision Trees
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### "I have Zoysia — is the care different from Bermuda?"

1. 95% the same program and products
2. Key differences: better shade tolerance (6-8 hrs vs 8+), slightly less aggressive, fewer army worm problems, less brown scalping, roots to 36 in vs 60 in
3. Same fertilizers, same PE program, same soil treatments
4. Mow height slightly different (0.5-2 in vs 0.75-1.5 in)

### "My Zoysia is thin/weak"

1. Get soil test → identify deficiencies
2. Apply PGF Complete (NOT organic — too mild for weak lawns)
3. Apply HUMICHAR for soil improvement
4. Ensure 6-8+ hours sun
5. Maintain proper mow height (0.5-2 in)
6. Be patient — Zoysia is a slow grower
7. Super Juice every 2-3 weeks for steady nutrition

### "Brown patches appearing"

1. Pull test: lifts easily → GRUBS (check 2-6 in deep)
2. Doesn't lift → FUNGUS (dollar spot or brown patch)
3. Grubs → Duocide at heavy rate + water in deeply
4. Fungus → Prophesy fungicide, rotate to BioAdvanced after 3 apps
5. Recovery: PGF Complete after treatment, ~6 weeks to heal

### "My grass is yellow"

1. Check watering → overwatering causes chlorosis
2. Check pH → high pH locks iron
3. Check fertilizer → high phosphorus?
4. Quick fix: Super Juice + liquid iron
5. Long-term: soil test

### "Should I seed or sod?"

1. Want fine blades → SOD only (no seed available for fine varieties)
2. Budget option → Zenith Zoysia seed (medium blade)
3. Germination takes up to 12 days (be patient)
4. Best timing: soil temp 65 F+ (daytime 80s)
5. DO NOT seed in fall
6. First year: be gentle, minimal treatments

### "When to start spring program"

1. Soil 50 F → Jump Start (PE + HUMICHAR + PGF 10-10-10 at 5 lbs/1K sqft)
2. Green haze + daily 70s → scalp to 50% of desired height
3. Soil 51-53 F → 1st PE (Andersons Barricade granular)
4. After scalp → 2nd PE (Dimension 2EW liquid)
5. Temps 80s → PGF Complete + Super Juice + Prophesy fungicide

### "My dog is burning the Zoysia"

1. Cause: nitrogen burn (NOT pH — common myth)
2. Immediate fix: flood area with water right after pee
3. Long-term: train dog to use non-lawn area
4. Cosmetic fix: Lawn Pee Spot treatment while grass regrows
5. Zoysia will grow back into spots in a few weeks naturally
