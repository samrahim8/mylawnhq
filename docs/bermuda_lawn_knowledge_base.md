# Bermuda Grass — Complete Knowledge Base

---

## Section 1: Grass Profile
<!-- complexity: simple -->

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Warm-season perennial |
| **Growth method** | Rhizomes (underground) + Stolons (above-ground); both have NODES (reproductive points) |
| **Ideal temp** | 85-90 F |
| **Dormancy trigger** | Below 50 F (turns brown, still alive — DO NOT use total-kill products) |
| **Sun requirement** | 8+ hours full sun per day (no truly shade-tolerant variety exists) |
| **Ideal pH** | 6.0-6.5 |
| **Root depth** | Up to 60 inches; most established lawns 8-16 inches |
| **Aggressiveness** | Most aggressive spreading grass in the US |
| **Core promise** | ANYONE can have a great Bermuda lawn — even if 70%+ weeds. Very forgiving. |

### Hybrid vs. Common Bermuda

| Feature | Hybrid | Common |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Origin | Lab-developed/bred | Natural/field-grown |
| Seed available | NO (sterile) | YES (cheap, widely available) |
| Blade type | Very fine, dense | Thick, coarse, wiry |
| Distribution | Sod or plugs only | Seed |
| Where found | Golf courses, premium lawns | Big box stores (Lowe's, Home Depot) |
| Cost | Higher (sod pricing) | Very cheap seed |

**Critical rule:** DO NOT overseed hybrid sod with cheap common Bermuda seed — texture and color differences will show.

### Shade Management
- Shaded areas are ALWAYS weaker — fertilizer will not fix this
- Shaded areas: keep HIGHER mowing height to maximize leaf surface area; also need LESS fertilizer
- Solutions: lift tree canopy (trim high), remove tree (last resort)

---

## Section 2: Mowing
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Height Guidelines

| Bermuda Type | Ideal Range | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Hybrid | 0.38-1.5 in | Finer blade = lower cut |
| Common | 1.0-2.0 in | Mow higher than hybrid |

**Key principle:** Cutting short forces HORIZONTAL spread (thickening), suffocates weeds, creates mat-like density. Tall Bermuda stalks are 30% green, 70% brown — the longer it gets, the more brown scalping occurs.

**Research note:** A 1990-91 study found lower cuts = fewer weeds (positive linear response between cutting height and crabgrass percentage) AND more biomass production.

### Cutting Frequency

| Period | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Peak season (Jun-Aug) | Every 2-3 days minimum; daily for show-quality |
| Golf fairways | Every 1-2 days |
| Fall (growth slowing) | Weekly until dormancy |
| Winter (dormant) | Cease; optional final mow for even appearance |

**1/3 rule:** Never remove more than 1/3 of blade in a single mow. Example: lawn at 1 in should be mowed before exceeding 1.5 in.

### Reel vs. Rotary

| Feature | Reel Mower | Rotary Mower |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Cut quality | Clean, precise (scissors action) | Tears grass (hatchet action) |
| Best for | Under 1.5 in cuts | Above 1 in cuts |
| Scalping risk | Lower (follows contours) | Higher (bounces on bumps) |
| Disease risk | Lower (cleaner cut) | Higher (torn blades) |
| Cost | $300-$1,500+ | Lower |

**Top pick:** McLane 25 in reel mower with front roller. For rotary: MUST have scalp wheels, change patterns often (horizontal, vertical, diagonals), avoid cutting on wet/soft soil.

### Spring Scalping

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target height | 50% of desired growing height (e.g., want 1.5 in = scalp to 0.75 in) |
| When | Full green haze appears, daily temps consistently in 70s (late Mar-early Apr in GA) |
| Rule | No such thing as too low — rhizomes and stolons ensure recovery |
| Tips | Bag all dead clippings; can scalp gradually over 4-6 weeks |

### Clippings and Dethatching
- **Always return clippings** when cutting frequently (thatch holds moisture)
- Dethatch ONLY if thatch exceeds 0.5 in
- DO NOT use prong-type dethatchers on Bermuda (damages runners) — use BLADED dethatcher (Sun Joe AJ801E) or DirtBooster + microbe booster spray
- Golf courses use VERTICUT or Fraze cut

### Plant Growth Regulators (PGR)

| PGR Type | Lateral Growth | Clipping Reduction | Turf Quality | Root Length |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Ethephon | Normal | Least (max 17%) | Acceptable (6.8-7.1) | Unaffected |
| Flurprimidol | Impeded ~25% | Most (>50%) | Unacceptable (3.6-5.2) | Reduced 25% |
| **Trinexapac-ethyl** | **Normal** | **Moderate** | **Excellent (8.0-8.4)** | **Increased 33%** |

**Winner: Trinexapac-ethyl (T-Nex / Primo Maxx)** — does not impede lateral growth, increases root density 33%, best turf quality.

**GDD reapplication:** Target 230-250 GDD at base 10 C. Example: Arlington, TX in Jul-Aug = ~22 GDD/day = apply every 10-11 days.

**Rate note:** Hybrid Bermuda needs 3-4x LESS PGR per application than Common Bermuda.

---

## Section 3: Watering
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Baseline Rule
- **1 inch of water per week** — deep and heavy beats frequent light waterings
- Deep watering promotes deeper roots = more drought tolerance
- Measure with tuna can test (1 in deep can; time how long to fill per zone)

### Seasonal Guide

| Season | Inches/Week | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Spring | 0.5-0.75 | Weekly |
| Summer | 1.0-1.5 | 2-3x/week |
| Fall | 0.5-1.0 | Weekly |
| Winter | Minimal | Rarely |

### Evapotranspiration (Advanced)
- Mean summer ET rate: 0.15-0.28 in/day
- Affected by variety, soil texture, root depth, slope, temp, sunlight
- Start at 1 in/week, adjust based on lawn response

### When to Water
- **Best:** Early morning, finish by sunrise
- **Avoid:** Midday (evaporation loss) and evening (fungus risk)
- Bermuda does NOT need mid-day "cool off" watering — it struggles from lack of water, not heat itself

### Drought Protocol (3+ weeks no rain, 90 F+)
- Switch to short cycle: light waterings morning + late afternoon
- 6-9 min per zone per watering
- Monitor water bill — can exceed $200/month in Southern droughts

### Hotspots
- Areas over construction debris, tree roots, septic drains, sand zones dry out fast
- Only solution: frequent light waterings for those zones

### Clay Soil Soak Cycling
Break watering into soak cycles to prevent runoff:

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Water | 10 min |
| Soak (off) | 20 min |
| Water | 10 min |
| Soak (off) | 20 min |
| Water | 10 min |

Delivers 30 min of water without runoff.

### Head-to-Head Sprinkler Coverage
- Each sprinkler head's spray must reach the adjacent head for even distribution
- Prevents brown/green patchy patterns

### Caution
- Constant wet soil / overwatering causes chlorosis (yellowing)

---

## Section 4: Fertilization
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### NPK Basics

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| N | Nitrogen — growth and green color |
| P | Phosphorus — root development |
| K | Potassium — stress tolerance |
| Numbers | Percentages by weight (16-4-8 = 4:1:2 ratio) |

### Recommended Ratio (Without Soil Test)
**4-1-2 ratio** (e.g., 16-4-8 = PGF Complete)

### Coverage Math
- 50 lb bag at 16% N = 8 lbs actual nitrogen
- At 1 lb N per 1,000 sq ft = covers 8,000 sq ft
- To get 1 lb N from 32-0-4: apply 3.125 lbs product per 1,000 sq ft (1 / 0.32)

### PGF Complete (16-4-8) — Primary Fertilizer

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Iron | 3% + micro nutrients + humic acid |
| Nitrogen types | 3 forms of high-quality N |
| Particle size | TINY (pro-grade coverage) |
| Application rate | 0.58 lbs N per 1,000 sq ft (mild) |
| Stacking | Apply every 3-6 weeks during push times |
| Source | No bio products, waste, sewage, or manures |

### N Application Rates by Lawn Condition

| Lawn State | Monthly N Rate (per 1,000 sq ft) | Frequency |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Thin/bare patches | 1.0-1.5 lbs N | Monthly |
| Mature/thick lawn | 0.5 lbs N | Monthly |
| Max push (liquid) | 0.25-0.5 lbs N | Weekly |

### Slow vs. Fast Release Nitrogen

| Feature | Slow Release | Fast Release |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| How it works | Coated urea, gradual over 4-8 weeks | Immediately available, lasts 2-3 weeks |
| Burn risk | Low | Higher (Bermuda recovers quickly) |
| Best for | Mature thick lawns | Thin lawns needing filling |
| Results | Gradual, even | Quick green-up |

**Common fast-release types:**
- Ammonium Sulfate (21-0-0): Quick N + lowers pH (dual purpose for high-pH soils)
- Urea (46-0-0): Highest N %, cheapest, no pH benefit

### Spoon Feeding (Advanced)
- Apply 0.25-0.5 lbs N per 1,000 sq ft weekly via liquid spray
- Keeps lawn consistently green without peaks/troughs
- Foliar uptake bypasses soil pH issues — nutrients absorbed directly through leaf
- Water in immediately to prevent burn

### Organic Fertilizers
- Preferred: Soy-based (INNOVA) over waste-based
- Cannot burn; adds carbon and amino acids
- Cons: very mild, must be digested by microbes, won't push weak lawns
- **Rule:** Weak/thin lawn = PGF Complete (chemical); healthy/thick lawn in summer = organic is fine; treat organics as SUPPLEMENTAL

### Spray Supplements

| Product | Type | Frequency | Key Benefit |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Super Juice | Foliar spray (dry powder + water) | Every 2-3 weeks | Reaches every blade; iron for deep green; contains humic/fulvic acid |
| GreenShocker | Fast-release foliar | As needed | Results in 3 days; mild enough for summer |

**Rule:** Granulars = bulk nutrients + growth impact. Spray supplements = mild + better overall health.

**Fall protocol:** STOP granulars, use ONLY Super Juice until first frost.

### Micronutrients
- Best applied as foliar spray (liquid on leaves)
- High-pH soils have uptake issues — foliar bypasses soil
- Iron sulfate cannot be absorbed by leaf — use chelated iron
- Boron and copper are toxic if granular not thoroughly mixed

### Rules
- Avoid "specialty" fertilizers (starter, weed & feed, root builders)
- Excess nutrients do NOT produce greater results
- Get a soil test to know deficiencies
- **WARNING:** High phosphorus causes problems — only add if soil test confirms deficiency

---

## Section 5: Seasonal Care Calendar
<!-- complexity: simple -->

*Based on daytime high temps. Default calibration: Middle Georgia. Adjust to your zone.*

### Late Winter (Soil Temps ~50 F)

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Soil test | Identifies deficiencies + pH (90% skip — move to next step) |
| Kick Start program | Apply simultaneously: granular pre-emergent + HUMICHAR at bag rate + PGF 10-10-10 |
| Kill existing weeds | Best while dormant; use Bermuda-safe spray; DO NOT use RoundUp |
| pH adjustments | Preferred timing (lime for low pH, pelletized sulfur for high pH) |

### Early Spring (Temps hitting 70s)

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Spring scalp | When full green haze appears; scalp to 50% of desired height |
| 1st granular PE | Before soil temps hit 51-53 F |
| 2nd liquid PE | Just after target date; catches seeds disturbed by scalping |

### Late Spring (Temps in 80s)

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| 1st PGF Complete | Begin growing-season fertilizer |
| Super Juice | Start spray program every 2-3 weeks |
| Preventative fungicide | P-DG when temps hit 80s |
| Aeration | Core-pull only; apply HUMICHAR in holes |
| Regular mowing | Begin seasonal schedule |

### Summer (Temps 85-95 F)

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| PGF Complete | Every 3-6 weeks |
| Super Juice | Every 2-3 weeks |
| HUMICHAR | As desired |
| Army worms | Watch Aug-Sep; treat with Dou-Kill |
| Grub treatment | At least 1 per year |
| Watering | Monitor; drought protocol if needed |
| GreenShocker | Quick green-up as needed |

### Fall

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Stop granulars | Switch to Super Juice only until first frost |
| Fall PE | At first cold weather (~Nov 15 in GA); prevents Poa annua |
| Potassium | Include ~1 lb K per 1,000 sq ft in final app (strengthens for dormancy) |
| Continue monthly N | Until 60 days before first hard frost |

### Winter (Dormant)

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| No fertilizer | Risks Spring Dead Spot disease |
| No total-kill products | Lawn is dormant but ALIVE |
| pH adjustments | Lime or sulfur (slow integration over winter) |
| Rolling | Off-season on moist soil if rut reduction needed |

---

## Section 6: Weed Control
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Weed Difficulty Tiers

| Category | Difficulty |
|----------|-----------|
| Broadleaf weeds | Easy |
| Grassy weeds | Easy |
| Crabgrass | Medium |
| Nutsedge | Medium (PEs don't control — treat separately) |
| Dallisgrass / Goosegrass | Very hard (spot treat with cloth + glyphosate on plant only) |

### Pre-Emergent Strategy

**"Pre-Emergent is God's gift to Bermuda lawn owners." With proper PE program, ZERO post-emergent weed killers needed.**

#### Split Application (Spring)

| Step | Timing | Type |
|------|--------|------|
| 1st app | Before soil temps hit 51-53 F | Long-lasting granular PE |
| 2nd app | Just after target date | Liquid with post-emergent properties on crabgrass |

#### Advanced PE Products Compared

| Product | Active Ingredient | Best For | Notes |
|---------|------------------|----------|-------|
| Barricade | Prodiamine | Spring, broad weed prevention | Long-lasting; gentlest on Bermuda |
| Specticle Flo | Indaziflam | Fall, Poa annua control | Superior residual; most expensive; cannot seed within 10 months |
| Dimension | Dithiopyr | Spring, early crabgrass | Also has POST-emergent action on young crabgrass |
| Pendimethalin | Pendimethalin | Annual grasses, some broadleaf | Older; 8-16% more Bermuda suppression than prodiamine |

#### Prodiamine Spring Protocol

| Timing | Rate (per 1,000 sq ft) |
|--------|------------------------|
| Soil temps at 50 F (~end Feb) | 0.3 oz |
| 30-60 days later | 0.3 oz |
| Optional summer touchup | 0.2 oz |
| **Annual max** | **0.83 oz** |

#### Indaziflam Fall Protocol

| Timing | Rate (per 1,000 sq ft) |
|--------|------------------------|
| Soil temps at 80 F (~Labor Day) | 2-3 mL |
| 30-45 days later (~mid Oct) | 2-3 mL |
| 30-45 days later (~Dec 1) | 2-3 mL |

**Poa annua germinates** when soil temps under 67 F for 7 consecutive days.

#### PE Application Rules
- Apply on dry soil, water in immediately
- Be early rather than late
- Must be watered into soil to activate
- Spraying provides better coverage than granular
- Rotate chemicals season-to-season to prevent resistance
- Aeration does NOT ruin PE (studies confirm minimal impact)

### Post-Emergent Weed Control

#### Celsius + Certainty System
Kills 99.9% of weeds in Bermuda without harming the grass.

| Product | Active Ingredient | Kills | Temp Limit | Speed |
|---------|------------------|-------|------------|-------|
| Celsius | Thiencarbazone + iodosulfuron + dicamba | Nearly all broadleaf | None | 2-3 weeks |
| Certainty | Sulfosulfuron | All grassy + Poa annua + nutsedge | None | 2-3 weeks |
| Tribute Total | Multiple AIs | 99.99% of weeds | 85-90 F max | Moderate |
| 2,4-D / SpeedZone | 2,4-D | Broadleaf | 85-90 F max | Fast |
| Quinclorac / Drive XLR8 | Quinclorac | Crabgrass | None | Fast |
| MSM Turf | Metsulfuron methyl | Tough broadleaf + some grassy | None | Slow |
| Dismiss | Sulfentrazone | Nutsedge + resistant weeds | None | Fast |
| Triclopyr | Triclopyr | Woody weeds, vines, poison ivy | None | Moderate |

#### Application Rules
- Spot spray (don't broadcast unless 40%+ infestation)
- Post-emergents should DRY on leaves (do NOT water in — opposite of PE)
- PE and post-emergent CAN be applied same day
- Slow-acting herbicides (Celsius/Certainty) cause LEAST stress to Bermuda

#### "Curtain of Death" — Lawns That Are Mostly Weeds
1. Apply mix of ALL weed killers + PE during warm/hot months
2. Will brown out Bermuda too (but won't kill it)
3. Fertilize (PGF Complete) + water heavily
4. Only Bermuda comes back
5. Next year: strict PE program

#### Non-Selective Options
- **41% Glyphosate:** Cheap (~$10), well-studied. Avoid RoundUp brand (formula varies by state, unnecessary additives, 2-3x cost)
- **RM43 (Glyphosate + Imazapyr):** Prevents regrowth up to 1 year — NOT for lawns where regrowth desired

---

## Section 7: Pest Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### Grubs

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| What they are | White, chubby worms feeding on ROOTS at 2-6 in deep |
| Signs | Brown patches that pull up easily; crows on lawn; armadillos/skunks digging |
| Treatment timing | Spring AND late summer/early fall |
| Primary product | Dou-Kill (Duocide) at HEAVY rate; water heavily into ground |
| Prevention | At least 1 grub treatment per year |
| Recovery | PGF Complete after killing grubs; heals in ~6 weeks |

#### Grub Lifecycle
1. **Summer:** Adult beetles lay eggs in soil
2. **Late summer-fall:** Eggs hatch, grubs feed on roots (PEAK DAMAGE)
3. **Winter:** Grubs burrow deeper, pause feeding
4. **Spring:** Brief feeding resumes, then pupate into adults
5. Cycle repeats

#### Treatment Phases

| Phase | Timing | Product |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Preventive | Late spring-early summer | Chlorantraniliprole (GrubEx) — bee-safe |
| Curative | Late summer-early fall | Trichlorfon or dylox (quick kill) |
| Maintenance | Fall-spring | Proper watering, fertilizing, mowing |

### Fall Army Worms

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Where they live | Above soil, in thatch layer |
| What they eat | Grass BLADES (visual damage, not root damage) |
| Feeding times | Morning and early evening |
| Typical battle | Aug-Sep (GA region); may need 2 treatments (egg hatch cycle) |
| Treatment | Dou-Kill (same as grubs); detect early for best results |
| Spread | Eggs laid by moths; spreads from neighbors |

---

## Section 8: Disease Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### Common Bermuda Fungal Diseases

| Disease | Appearance | Conditions | Season |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Brown Patch | Circular brown dead patches | Warm, humid | Summer-Fall |
| Dollar Spot | Silver-dollar-sized spots, coalesce | Moist, nutrient-deficient | Spring-Fall |
| Spring Dead Spot | Circular dead patches in spring | Fungal infection from previous autumn | Spring |
| Leaf Spot | Small dark spots expanding to brown/purple lesions | Wet, fluctuating temps | Spring |
| Pythium Blight | Greasy, water-soaked spots, slimy | Hot, humid nights | Summer |
| Fairy Ring | Dark green circles/arcs, sometimes mushrooms | Organic matter in soil | Any |
| Take-All Root Rot | Thinning yellow patches, weak roots | Acidic soils, moist | Spring-Summer |
| Grey Leaf Spot | Small oval grey spots | High humidity + temp | Summer |

### Causes of Fungus
- Excessive moisture / overwatering
- Poor air circulation and compacted soil
- Dense thatch and improper mowing
- Nutrient imbalance and extreme temps

### Prevention
- When temps reach 80s in spring, apply PRO DG Fungicide (preventative)
- DG particles provide superior coverage + longer lasting than most sprays

### Treatment Protocol
1. Apply P-DG fungicide at bag rate (up to 3 times)
2. SWITCH to BioAdvanced spray product (fungus develops resistance)
3. Rotate chemicals to prevent resistance

### Fungicides by Active Ingredient

| Product | Active Ingredient | Best For |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Heritage | Azoxystrobin | Brown Patch, Dollar Spot (broad spectrum) |
| Banner MAXX | Propiconazole | Brown Patch, Spring Dead Spot |
| Insignia | Pyraclostrobin | Dollar Spot (preventive) |
| Eagle 20EW | Myclobutanil | Dollar Spot, Brown Patch |
| Cleary's 3336F | Thiophanate-methyl | Bermuda Decline, Brown Patch, Dollar Spot, Take-All Patch |

### Chlorosis (Yellow Blades)

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Overwatering | Reduce irrigation |
| High phosphorus | Soil test; switch to zero-P fertilizer |
| pH locking up iron | Spray Super Juice + liquid iron; correct pH |

### Red/Purple Blades

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Stress/cold damage (most common) | Wait — goes away in weeks |
| Phosphorus deficiency | Apply light 10-10-10 |

---

## Section 9: Soil & pH
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Ideal pH: 6.0-6.5

| Condition | Treatment | Rate | Timing |
|-----------|-----------|------|--------|
| Low pH (acidic) | Lime | Per bag rate | Preferred: dormant season; can be done anytime |
| High pH (alkaline) | Pelletized sulfur | 5 lbs per 1,000 sq ft | Air temps below 75 F only; recheck in 3 months |

- pH doesn't directly affect grass — it affects **nutrient availability**
- High pH locks up iron in soil
- Large pH changes may take several years

### Soil Testing
- Identifies nutrient deficiencies + pH level
- Cheapest option: Clemson Extension (~$3)
- 90% of people skip this — at minimum use general 4-1-2 ratio recommendations

### HUMICHAR (Soil Amendment)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Composition | 50/50 Humic Acid + Biochar, formed into DG particles |
| Application | Contains NO nutrients; safe anytime, with any product; cannot over-apply |
| Best timing | After aeration — blow particles into holes |

| Component | What It Does | Speed |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Humic acid | Improves CEC (hold/release nutrients), adds carbon, improves germination, increases microbes, improves soil structure | Fast |
| Biochar | Improves organic carbon, water holding capacity, stimulates microbes, decreases leaching, aids carbon sequestration | Slow, lasts decades |

### Adding Organic Matter
- Lawns never get natural decomposition — poor soil over time
- HUMICHAR replaces missing carbon and organic matter
- DirtBooster: applied via spreader + microbe booster spray; apply when temps above 80 F

### Lawn Leveling

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Mix | 70% sand + 30% organic matter (or clean sand) |
| Timing | ONLY during growing season |
| Process | Scalp to ground first; multiple treatments needed |
| Large yards | Invest in reel mower + off-season rolling; leveling mix won't fix 2-3 in ruts |

### Primary Cations

| Cation | When Low | How to Apply |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Calcium | Common in sandy Southeast soils | Gypsum or lime |
| Potassium | Low in heavy-rain areas (FL) | Potash (KCl) or 0-0-50 |
| Magnesium | Low in acidic soils (Northeast) | Dolomitic lime or Epsom salt |
| Sodium | Rarely needs adding; can rise near coasts | Monitor only |

---

## Section 10: Establishment
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Seeding

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Best timing | Daytime temps in 80s (late spring/early summer) |
| OK timing | Summer months with LOTS of water |
| DO NOT | Plant in early spring or fall |
| Seed depth | 1/8 to 1/4 in |
| Spreader | Hand spreader at bag rate or heavier |
| Pre-emergent rule | No PE for 3 months prior to seeding |

#### Seeding Steps
1. Treat for weeds 2-3 weeks BEFORE seeding
2. Ensure rain/watering has washed away weed killers
3. Heavily rake or rent bladed dethatcher/scarifier to loosen soil
4. Spread seed at 1/8-1/4 in depth
5. Water 2-3x daily (lightly) until germination
6. Then once daily for 2 more weeks — keep soil moist

#### First Season (New Seed)
- No weed killers for first 2 months; very sparingly after that
- Deal with some weeds — address next year with PE
- Fertilize with PGF Complete (18 lb bag per 5,000 sq ft) — NOT starter fertilizer

### Quality Bermuda Seed Varieties

| Variety | Price/lb | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Arden 15 | $22-$32 | Pennington's upgrade to Princess 77; improved cold tolerance; dark green; medium fine texture |
| LaPrima XD | $16-$29 | Blend of Yukon + Royal Bengal; "X-treme Density"; fast establishment |
| Black Jack | $7-$9 | Fine-textured; dark green; cold tolerant; good for overseeding |
| Yukon | $20-$29 | Oklahoma State developed; most cold tolerant seeded Bermuda; best for transition zones |

**Note:** All Bermuda seed at big box stores is COMMON Bermuda. Quality seed runs $7-$35/lb.

### Sod

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Best timing | Early to late spring (peak growing season) |
| Pre-emergent | DO NOT apply before laying — limits root growth |
| Soil prep | Get soil test if time permits; light 10-10-10 a few weeks before; apply HUMICHAR |

#### New Sod Watering

| Week | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Week 1 | 3x/day |
| Week 2 | 2x/day |
| Week 3 | 1x/day |

Keep slightly moist, NOT wet — don't let dry out.

#### First Year Sod Care
- Be gentle — light PGF Complete and light Super Juice only
- Spot treat or live with weeds
- **NO pre-emergent for 8-12 months** (stops new root growth)
- Second year: start full program

### Transplanting Runners
- Let runners grow onto sidewalk/driveway (don't edge)
- "Steal" runners and plant in bare spots
- 99% of lawns can be restored via natural spreading — DON'T seed if lawn is 70%+ Bermuda

### Aeration

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Method | CORE PULLING aerator only (NOT spike units) |
| Timing | Spring to early summer (active growing season) |
| Post-aeration | Apply heavy HUMICHAR; blow into holes |
| PE impact | Does NOT ruin pre-emergent treatments |

### Ryegrass Overseeding Conflict
- Fall PE can prevent ryegrass germination
- Specticle Flo: cannot seed within 10 months of application
- Check label compatibility before combining PE with overseeding plans

---

## Section 11: Troubleshooting Decision Trees
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### "My lawn is mostly weeds, what do I do?"
1. Apply "Curtain of Death" — all weed killers + PE during warm/hot months
2. Bermuda will brown but NOT die
3. Fertilize (PGF Complete) + water heavily
4. Only Bermuda returns
5. Next year: strict PE program

### "Should I seed or wait?"
1. Is lawn 70%+ Bermuda? -> DON'T seed; let it spread naturally
2. Bare spots? -> Steal runners from sidewalk/driveway edges
3. Must seed? -> Quality seed (Arden 15, LaPrima XD, Yukon, Black Jack) — NEVER big box common seed
4. Temps in 80s? -> Good to go
5. Below 80s? -> Wait

### "My grass is yellow"
1. Check watering (overwatering?)
2. Check pH (high pH locks up iron)
3. Check fertilizer (high phosphorus? e.g., Milorganite)
4. Quick fix: Super Juice + liquid iron
5. Long-term: soil test

### "Brown patches appearing"
1. Pull test: lifts easily? -> Likely GRUBS (check 2-6 in deep)
2. Doesn't lift? -> Likely FUNGUS (dollar spot or brown patch)
3. Grubs -> Dou-Kill at heavy rate + water in
4. Fungus -> P-DG fungicide; rotate to BioAdvanced after 3 apps

### "When do I start in spring?"
1. Soil temps hit 50 F -> Kick Start (PE + HUMICHAR + 10-10-10)
2. Green haze + daily 70s -> Spring scalp
