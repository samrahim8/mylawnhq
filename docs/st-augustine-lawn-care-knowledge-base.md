# St. Augustine Grass — Complete Knowledge Base

---

## Section 1: Grass Profile
<!-- complexity: simple -->

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Scientific name** | _Stenotaphrum secundatum_ (Walt.) Kuntze |
| **Type** | Warm-season perennial |
| **Growth method** | Above-ground stolons (runners) — NOT rhizomes |
| **Common regions** | Florida, Texas, California, Hawaii, Gulf Coast, coastal Southeast |
| **Sun requirement** | 6+ hours direct sun/day (best shade tolerance among warm-season grasses) |
| **Salt tolerance** | Good — suitable for coastal properties |
| **Drought resistance** | Moderate — shallow roots make it vulnerable to prolonged drought |
| **Traffic tolerance** | Moderate |
| **Ideal pH** | 6.0–6.5 (tolerates 6.0–7.5) |
| **Soil preference** | Sandy, moderately fertile, moist, well-drained; does not tolerate compaction well |
| **Dormancy** | Green year-round in South FL / coastal; dormant/brown in cooler climates |
| **Establishment** | Sod, plugs, or sprigs ONLY — **no commercial seed available** |
| **Maintenance level** | Moderate to high |
| **Nicknames** | "St. Fungustine" (disease susceptibility), "Charleston grass" (SC) |

### Popular Cultivars

| Cultivar | Sun / Shade | Mow Height | Key Notes |
|----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Floratam** | 5–6 hrs sun; best in full sun | 3–4" | Most purchased turf in FL and Gulf Coast |
| **Palmetto** | Full sun; tolerates partial shade | ~3" | Good drought tolerance, vibrant color, resilient roots |
| **Seville** | Good shade tolerance | ~2" | Semi-dwarf; needs regular insecticide for chinch bugs and webworms |
| **Captiva** | Reasonable shade tolerance | ~2.5" | Chinch bug resistant; requires 1/3 less mowing than Floratam |
| **Raleigh** | Variable | 3–4" | Best cold tolerance among St. Augustine cultivars |

---

## Section 2: Mowing
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Height Guidelines

| Scenario | Height |
|----------|--------|
| Standard cultivars (Floratam, Palmetto, Raleigh) | 3–4 inches |
| Dwarf cultivars (Seville, Captiva) | 2–2.5 inches |
| Shade conditions | 4–4.5 inches (more blade = more light absorption) |
| During drought | Increase height |

### Cutting Frequency

| Season | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Summer (peak growth) | Every 5–7 days |
| Spring / Fall | Every 7–10 days |
| Dormant (cooler climates) | Do NOT mow brown grass; resume when it greens up |
| Warm climates (no dormancy) | Year-round mowing required |

### Best Practices

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| 1/3 rule | Never remove more than 1/3 of blade at once |
| Blade sharpness | Sharpen monthly during growing season; dull blades tear grass and increase disease |
| Clippings | Leave on lawn for nutrient recycling (do NOT contribute to thatch if mowing regularly) |
| Mower type | Rotary mower at 2–3.5" cut height |
| Pattern | Alternate mowing direction to reduce compaction |
| Ideal interval | 7–10 days for best appearance (Super-Sod) |

**Critical:** Mowing too short causes thinning, weakens turf, and opens the door to weed invasion.

---

## Section 3: Watering
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### General Guidelines

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weekly water need | 1–2 inches (rainfall + irrigation combined) |
| Optimal (Super-Sod) | 2 inches per week |
| Starting point (OtO) | 1 inch per week, adjust from there |
| Frequency | Deep watering 2–3x per week (NOT daily shallow watering) |
| Best time | Early morning — reduces evaporation and fungal disease risk |
| Drought vulnerability | High — shallow roots make St. Augustine susceptible during prolonged drought |

### Signs of Moisture Stress

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Leaf blades wilt or curl | Under-watered |
| Color shifts to blue-gray | Under-watered |
| Screwdriver test fails (can't push 6" in) | Under-watered |
| Water runs down street | Over-watered — scale back |

### New Sod Watering Schedule (UF/IFAS)

| Timeframe | Protocol |
|-----------|----------|
| Days 1–10 | Multiple short (5–10 min) irrigations throughout the day; keep soil consistently moist |
| Days 11–20 | Once daily, 1/4–1/2 inch of water |
| Days 21–28 | 2–3 times per week, 1/4–1/2 inch each |
| After establishment (3–4 weeks) | As-needed basis only |

### Water Conservation

- Only irrigate to supplement rainfall shortages; skip irrigation if 2+ inches of rain in a week
- Use rain gauge or empty tuna can to measure weekly input
- Avoid fixed-timer irrigation; use smart controllers or rain sensors
- Water in split applications to prevent runoff; avoid standing water
- ~50% of outdoor irrigation water in the US is wasted due to poor techniques (OtO stat)

---

## Section 4: Fertilization
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Annual Nitrogen Recommendations (UF/IFAS — Florida)

| Region | lbs N / 1,000 sq ft / year |
|--------|----------------------------|
| North Florida (north of Ocala) | 2–4 |
| Central Florida (Ocala to State Road 60) | 2–5 |
| South Florida (south of State Road 60) | 4–6 |

> Assumes clippings are recycled. Adjust based on soil test, shade, drought, and irrigation availability.

### Timing Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Split applications | 2–6 applications during active growth |
| First application | Early spring after last frost (mid-April Central FL; later in North FL) |
| Ongoing | Every 6–8 weeks through summer and early fall |
| South Florida | May fertilize year-round |
| New sod | Wait **30–60 days** after planting before first fertilizer |
| Do NOT | Fertilize late in year after growth slows; no high-N in fall/winter dormancy |

### Best Practices

| Practice | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Nitrogen need | Heavy N feeder; use high-nitrogen fertilizer |
| N:K ratio | 2:1 or 1:1 recommended |
| Release type | Slow-release preferred for steady nutrient supply |
| Supplemental iron | Improves summer color; wash off concrete immediately to prevent staining |
| Over-fertilization | Causes thatch buildup, disease risk, unhealthy lawn |
| Soil testing | Conduct before fertilizing; use home kit or local UF/IFAS Extension |
| Application | Do NOT apply to wet turf; sweep granular off hard surfaces |

### Super-Sod Recommended Fertilizer Schedule

| Month | Product (lbs/1,000 sq ft) | Timing |
|-------|--------------------------|--------|
| **FEB** | 0-0-7 + Iron w/ pre-emergent @ 6 lbs | Middle of month |
| **MAY** | 16-4-8 + Iron @ 6 lbs | After full green-up |
| **JUL** | 5-10-30 + Iron @ 5 lbs | Middle of month |
| **AUG** | 16-4-8 + Iron @ 6 lbs | Middle of month |
| **OCT** | 0-0-7 + Iron w/ pre-emergent @ 6 lbs | First week |
| **NOV** | Muriate of Potash @ 1 lb | Middle of month |

### UF/IFAS Maintenance Calendar — Fertilizer Notes

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| January | Complete soil test; adjust fertilizer plan |
| March–April | Fertilize with complete NPK + micronutrients + slow-release K after last frost |
| Summer | Apply slow-release N; supplement with iron for color |
| September | Complete soil test again |
| Fall/Winter | Low-nitrogen only (e.g., 0-0-7); no high-N during dormancy |

---

## Section 5: Seasonal Care Calendar
<!-- complexity: simple -->

> Based on UF/IFAS St. Johns County Extension + Super-Sod schedules. Adjust for local climate.

| Month | Tasks |
|-------|-------|
| **JAN** | Soil test. Adjust/calibrate irrigation. Service equipment. |
| **FEB** | Apply 0-0-7 + Iron w/ pre-emergent @ 6 lbs/1K (mid-month). Adjust irrigation. |

## Section 6: Weed Control
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Prevention First

Healthy, thick St. Augustine turf is the best natural weed control — its dense growth crowds out weeds. Weeds invade when turf is stressed or thinned (drought, disease, mowing too short).

| Natural Method | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| Grass clippings | Leave as mulch to block weed seeds from sunlight |
| Corn gluten meal | Natural pre-emergent option |
| Deep watering | Deeper grass roots leave less space for weed roots |
| Spot treatment | Vinegar spray or boiling water for individual weeds |

### Pre-Emergent Herbicides

| Timing | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Spring | Apply when soil temps reach ~65 F (around March 1 in FL) |
| Fall | Apply when soil temps reach ~65 F again (around October 1 in FL) |
| Second app | 60 days after first, or per label |
| New sod/plugs | Do NOT apply pre-emergent while establishing |

### Post-Emergent Herbicides

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Temperature window | Below 90 F and above 40 F |
| Summer/winter | Spot-treat only when grass is stressed |
| Application time | Morning or evening to avoid burning during high heat |

### WARNING: Herbicide Sensitivity

**St. Augustine is SENSITIVE to certain herbicides:**
- **2,4-D** can damage St. Augustine, especially during spring green-up and hot summer temps
- **ALWAYS** read the label — ONLY use herbicides that specifically state safe for St. Augustine
- Wrong herbicide selection can kill or severely damage your lawn

## Section 7: Pest Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### Major Pests

#### Southern Chinch Bug (Primary Threat — #1 Pest)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| What they do | Suck moisture from grass blades and inject a toxin that kills grass |
| Symptoms | Irregular yellow/brown patches that mimic drought stress but don't respond to watering |
| Peak activity | June–August; can appear earlier in warmer areas |
| Treatment | Targeted insecticide; **rotate products** — chinch bugs develop pyrethroid resistance |
| Approach | Spot-treat infested areas |

#### Mole Crickets

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| What they do | Tunnel through soil, damaging grass roots |
| Peak activity | Hatch in spring |
| Treatment | Insecticide in early morning or late afternoon; baiting effective in fall |

#### Sod Webworms / Tropical Sod Webworms

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| What they do | Feed on grass blades, causing irregular brown patches |
| Peak activity | Warm months (summer into fall) |

#### Fall Armyworms

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Peak activity | September–October |
| Damage | Can devastate lawns rapidly; monitor closely in fall |

#### White Grubs

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| What they do | Feed on grass roots below soil surface |
| Symptoms | Spongy, loose turf that can be pulled up like carpet |

### Pest Treatment Schedule

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| June | Begin chinch bug treatment (rotate products) |
| June–Aug | Chinch bug spot-treatment as needed |
| Spring | Mole cricket treatment (early AM / late PM) |
| July | Broad-spectrum insecticide (e.g., Talstar XTRA @ 3.5 lbs/1K — Super-Sod rec.); reapply as needed |
| Summer–Fall | Monitor for tropical sod webworms and fall armyworms |
| Fall | Mole cricket baiting |

---

## Section 8: Disease Management
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### Common Diseases

| Disease | When Active | Symptoms | Causes |
|---------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Large Patch (Brown Patch)** | Fall (Oct–Nov) and spring | Circular patches of brown, thinning turf | Excessive watering + N in humid conditions |
| **Gray Leaf Spot** | Summer (peak) | Small brown/gray spots on leaf blades | Excessive N + humidity |
| **Take-All Root Rot (TARR)** | Spring (peak) | Yellowing, thinning, root deterioration | Very difficult to manage; extremely hard to cure |
| **Pythium Root Rot** | Warm, wet conditions | Root decay, thinning | Overwatering |
| **St. Augustine Decline (SAD)** | Variable | Yellowing, mottling of leaves | **Viral — no chemical cure**; use resistant cultivars only |

### Prevention Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| #1 cause | Over-watering |
| #2 cause | Over-fertilizing |
| Watering time | Early morning so grass dries before evening |
| Mowing | Proper height with sharp blades |
| Airflow | Ensure good air circulation and drainage |
| Fungicide | Apply preventative treatments per schedule |

### Fungicide Schedule (Super-Sod)

| Month | Action |
|-------|--------|
| June | Professional fungicide — first week of month |
| October | Professional fungicide — middle of month |

### When to Consider Lawn Replacement

TARR is extremely difficult to cure and prevent. If disease returns year after year despite proper care, consider replacing St. Augustine with:
- **TifTuf Bermudagrass** — drought-tolerant, deep roots, fewer disease issues
- **Zoysia varieties** (Emerald, Zenith) — lower maintenance, better disease resistance

**SAD (St. Augustine Decline)** is a viral disease with **no cure**. If confirmed, the only option is replacing with a SAD-resistant cultivar (e.g., Floratam, Raleigh) or switching grass types entirely.

---

## Section 9: Soil & pH
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Ideal pH: 6.0–6.5

| Condition | Treatment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Low pH (below 6.0) | Lime | Apply based on soil test; safe any time of year |
| High pH (above 7.5) | Pelletized sulfur | Apply per bag rate; recheck in 3 months [INFERRED] |

- pH affects **nutrient availability**, not the grass directly
- Soil testing: use at-home kit or contact local UF/IFAS Extension office
- St. Augustine prefers sandy, well-drained soil; does not tolerate compaction

### Thatch Management

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Good thatch (< 1 inch) | Provides nutrients as it decomposes; insulates soil |
| Bad thatch (> 1 inch) | Blocks water, air, nutrients; causes shallow roots; harbors disease |
| When to dethatch | Thatch exceeds 1 inch; best in early spring before pre-emergent |

**CAUTION — Shallow Roots:** St. Augustine has shallow roots. Avoid aggressive power dethatching machines — they tear up roots and cause significant damage.

| Lawn Size | Recommended Method |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Small lawns | Hand rake only |
| All lawns | Core aerate, then topdress with compost (e.g., Soil3). Beneficial bacteria break down thatch naturally. |
| Ongoing prevention | Bag clippings when mowing; avoid over-fertilizing |

### Aeration

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| What it does | Pulls cores of earth, relieving compaction; allows nutrients/water/air to reach roots |
| When | Spring, after last frost; turf 75% green and soil temps above 65 F |
| Post-aeration | Topdress with compost (Super-Sod recommends Soil3 bulk compost) |

---

## Section 10: Establishment
<!-- complexity: simple -->

### Planting Methods

| Method | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Sod** | Large areas, instant coverage | Most common; water immediately |
| **Plugs** | Medium areas | 64-count tray ~$110+; runners fill gaps over time |
| **Sprigs (stolons)** | Very small areas | Grass stems with roots intact |

**Critical:** St. Augustine seed is extremely expensive and NOT commercially viable. Always use vegetative methods (sod, plugs, sprigs).

### Best Planting Times (UF/IFAS)

| Region | Best Time | Avoid |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| North & Central Florida | Spring and late summer/early fall | Cold winter, hot dry summer |
| South Florida | Late fall, winter, or spring | Extreme heat |
| Tropical (no dormancy) | Year-round | — |

### Post-Planting Care

| Task | Timing |
|------|--------|
| Watering | Follow new sod schedule (Section 3); keep moist until rooted |
| First mow | 14–21 days after planting (once well rooted) |
| First fertilization | 30–60 days after planting |
| Pre-emergent | Do NOT apply while new sod/plugs are establishing |

## Section 11: Troubleshooting Decision Trees
<!-- complexity: reasoning -->

### "My St. Augustine has brown/yellow patches"
[INFERRED]

1. **Irrigation check:** Are patches responding to extra water?
   - YES → drought stress. Increase watering to 1–2 in/week, deep 2–3x/week
   - NO → continue to step 2
2. **Pull test:** Does turf pull up easily like carpet?
   - YES → likely **white grubs** feeding on roots. Apply insecticide and water in.
   - NO → continue to step 3
3. **Patch shape:** Circular brown patches with defined edges?
   - YES → likely **large patch (brown patch)** fungus. Apply fungicide; reduce watering and nitrogen.
   - NO → continue to step 4
4. **Season:** Is it June–August? Are patches irregular and drought-like?
   - YES → likely **southern chinch bugs**. Part grass at patch edge and look for small black-and-white insects. Treat with insecticide; rotate products.
   - NO → continue to step 5
5. **Root condition:** Are roots dark, rotted, or easily pulled?
   - YES → likely **take-all root rot (TARR)**. Apply fungicide; avoid over-watering. See TARR/SAD decision tree.
   - NO → possible nutrient deficiency. Get a soil test.

### "What's eating my St. Augustine?" (Pest Diagnosis)
[INFERRED]

1. **When is damage occurring?**
   - June–August + irregular yellow/brown patches not responding to water → **southern chinch bugs** (check at patch edges for tiny black-and-white insects). Treat with insecticide; rotate products to prevent pyrethroid resistance.
   - September–October + rapid widespread browning → **fall armyworms** (look for caterpillars feeding morning/evening). Treat with broad-spectrum insecticide.
   - Summer into fall + irregular brown patches on blades → **tropical sod webworms** (moths flying at dusk, notched blades). Treat with insecticide.
   - Spring + soft/spongy turf with tunneling → **mole crickets** (treat early AM or late PM; bait in fall).
   - Any season + spongy turf that lifts like carpet → **white grubs** (dig 2–6 inches; look for white C-shaped larvae). Treat with insecticide and water in.
2. **Not sure?** Apply Talstar XTRA granular @ 3.5 lbs/1K as a broad-spectrum approach (covers chinch bugs, mole crickets, webworms, armyworms).

### "My lawn keeps getting fungus" (Disease Prevention)
[INFERRED]

1. **Are you over-watering?** Water only 1–2 in/week, early morning, deep 2–3x/week. Never evening irrigation.
2. **Are you over-fertilizing?** Stick to UF/IFAS N rates for your FL region. Slow-release only.
3. **Mowing height correct?** Standard cultivars 3–4 in, dwarf 2–2.5 in. Sharp blades only.
4. **Preventative fungicide applied?** Apply professional fungicide in June (first week) and October (mid-month) per Super-Sod schedule.
5. **Still recurring?** Rotate fungicide active ingredients to prevent resistance. Ensure good drainage and air circulation.
6. **Disease every year despite all of the above?** Consider lawn replacement — see TARR/SAD decision tree.

### "When do I start my spring program?" (FL-Centric Timing)
[INFERRED]

1. **January:** Complete soil test; calibrate irrigation; service equipment.
2. **February (mid-month):** Apply 0-0-7 + Iron w/ pre-emergent @ 6 lbs/1K.
3. **March (soil temps reach ~65 F):** Apply pre-emergent. Apply slow-release N + iron. Core aerate if needed.
4. **April (after last frost):** Fertilize with complete NPK + micronutrients. Post-emergent herbicide spot-treatment as needed.
5. **May (after full green-up):** Apply 16-4-8 + Iron @ 6 lbs/1K. Begin monitoring for chinch bugs and mole crickets.
6. **South Florida:** May fertilize year-round; adjust timing accordingly.

### "Should I replace my St. Augustine?" (TARR/SAD Decision)
[INFERRED]

1. **Diagnose the issue:**
   - Yellowing + thinning + root deterioration returning each spring → likely **TARR (take-all root rot)**
   - Yellowing + leaf mottling + no response to treatment → likely **SAD (St. Augustine Decline)** — viral, no chemical cure
2. **If TARR:**
   - Have you applied proper fungicides for 2+ seasons? → YES: continue to step 3. NO: try a full fungicide program first (June + October).
   - Is the damage spreading despite treatment? → YES: TARR is extremely difficult to cure. Consider replacement.
3. **If SAD:**
   - Is your cultivar SAD-resistant (Floratam, Raleigh)? → NO: replace with a resistant cultivar.
   - YES and still declining? → Confirm viral diagnosis; SAD-resistant cultivars can still get other diseases.
4. **Replacement options:**
   - Want to stay warm-season, low disease? → **TifTuf Bermudagrass** (drought-tolerant, deep roots, fewer disease issues)
   - Want lower maintenance? → **Zoysia** (Emerald, Zenith) — better disease resistance
   - Want to try St. Augustine again? → Use a different, resistant cultivar and commit to strict prevention.

### "My grass is yellow" (Chlorosis)
[INFERRED]

1. **Check watering:** Over-watering causes chlorosis. Reduce to 1–2 in/week if excessive.
2. **Check soil pH:** pH above 7.0 can lock up iron. Get soil test.
   - pH too high → apply pelletized sulfur; recheck in 3 months
   - pH too low (below 6.0) → apply lime
3. **Check nitrogen:** Is the lawn under-fed? St. Augustine is a heavy N feeder. Apply slow-release N per UF/IFAS regional rates.
4. **Quick green-up fix:** Apply supplemental iron treatment (use sparingly; wash off concrete immediately).
5. **If persistent:** Get full soil test for nutrient deficiencies. Check for root problems (TARR can cause yellowing/thinning).
